I‘m back in Hamburg after a 2 week trip to England in our van. When I’m not editing pictures this is what I’m focusing on.


### Currently Reading

- I just finished [Brief Answers to the Big Questions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40277241-brief-answers-to-the-big-questions) by Stephen Hawking. 

Now I’m working through a few books I still haven’t finished:

- [Don’t make me think](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41009404-dont-make-me-think) by Steve Krug
- [The Greatest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34056102-the-greatest) by Matthew Syed
- [Norse Mythology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37903770-norse-mythology) by Neil Gaiman


### Current Projects

- We working on [a few new update](https://harrycr.es/2Z6HF7l) to [indtl.com](https://indtl.com/) which will launch very soon. 
- I’m in the process of building [SeedTribe v.3.0](https://harrycr.es/2IjtyVF). We’re using [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) for the CMS. It’s what they call ’headless’, meaning you can query the data in the form of a JSON API from any front-end you choose. We went with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for this and we use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to query the the data.
- I recently built [a mini jobs board](https://clever-perlman-f0786d.netlify.com/) to test out a new workflow. This is my first crack at building a React app and working with CSS-in-JS. It’s built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) and [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) for a Git based CMS.

### Currently Studying

- ReactJS, GatsbyJS and GraphQL
- [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/), a collection of utility functions that add style props to your React components
- [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)
