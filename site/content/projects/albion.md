### Design Brief

Following our meeting we recieved a design brief which clarified key objectives and detailed the current product offering. 

The brief covered what was expected from the look and feel of the website and specific functionality requirements. We used the brief to crosscheck our notes and identify anything we’d missed during our inital meeting. 

Following this I conducted my own research to learn more about the market, product, target audience and competition.

### Mood Board

Inspiration and visual references collected by the team helped build a picture of a style that best suited the brand vision. Together we discussed the references to help pinpoint specific details which we could use to inform the design and gathered more to fill the gaps. 

With a photographer founder it was clear there would be a strong focus on imagery throughtout the website.

## The Mission

We identified 3 core requirements for the project. 

**1. Create a new website and eCommerce platform**
Create a seamless user experience between content and store and provide an easy and intuitive way for the team to manage content and product inventory.

**2. Create an integrated weather application**
Weather conditions must be easy for riders to discover based on a given location. The app must be able to pair riding advice and product suggestions with the forecast.

**3. Build an email marketing funnel**
Using an email marketing tool, the objective was to create a way for the team to build a following, connect with their customers and share content with their supporters.

## Brand and Style

The team were well organised, having already mapped out the basic website structure.  Written content had also been finalised and initial product shots photographed.

Other than the a small set of brand materials – logo, lead typeface (Apercu) and initial imagery – we had a clean slate to work with. My plan was to expand on what already existed by introducing a contrasting typeface, a colour palette and a component system that could scale easily in the future.

## User experience

Working with data collected during the research phase, I built a basic site map to help visualise the website architecture and high level page structure. This helped guide the user experience and wireframe development.

Next, I created several user flows to get a better idea of a potential visitor journeys. We reviewed these together to identify any pitfalls in the plan.

## Sketching

Sketching sessions were a fast and effective way to visualise our ideas without distraction. We produced several low-fidelity sketches to map out the hierarchy of information and establish a suitable layout. 

We identified 3 specific elements which would become the websites signature.

1. **Weather app homepage hero**
2. **Off-canvas basket**
3. **Monospaced companion typeface**

One of the key objectives was to help riders connect with the brand philosophy “Road cycling in all sorts of weather”. Using the concept of weather as a theme to guide the design, I  suggested the idea of the weather app becoming the lead feature of the homepage. We visualised this as an interactive component in the hero section.

## Wireframing

Based on feedback received, I produced several ‘black and white’ mid-fidelity wireframes in Sketch. These helped us visualise the content, and solidify our layout ideas. 
 
At this stage I began to consider both UI elements – buttons, form elements and icons etc – and a typography system, to define all the different components necessary throughout the website.

## Prototyping

Using Sketch and InVision, I made a hi-fidelity clickable prototype, to share with the team for further feedback and testing. InVision proved an effective way to streamline feedback and communication between the team.

[INSERT HI FI PROTOTYPES]

I carried out a user testing exercise with a closed group of volunteers to gather unbiased feedback on the overall user experience and observe how visitors would interact with the product. Based on this research I made final adjustments and began to finalise the design system into a cohesive experience. 

Note: Since the initial prototype designed in Sketch,  there have been several design updates and the prototype now lives in Figma.

## Design System

Extracting UI elements into a design system helped with design consistency and allowed us to visualise the various elements that needed to built in code. 

Having a central repository for design patterns used in the website helped to establish a visual language and promotes design thinking in components and not pages.

[INSERT DESIGN SYSTEM STILLS]

The design system now acts as a single source of truth for both design and development and has become a useful aid when returning to the project after time to make iterations and improvements. With design patterns all in one place, we can easily identify specific components and focus on each one independently, whilst maintaining a unified design language.

## Technology

Luke and I worked together with the team from the start, to identify the most appropriate technologies for the job and those the team were most comfortable using. This made sure we were on the same page from the beginning of the project and helped us pinpoint any design restrictions and considerations we may have to make.

- **Wordpress**
- **Shopify API**
- **Weather API**
- **Mailchimp**

The core website is powered by Wordpress, which makes blog posts, pages and look book entries easy to manage via the Wordpress CMS. Th Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK takes care of the  store functionality, allowing the Albion team to take payments, receive orders and manage inventory via the Shopify CMS.

The custom weather app featured on the homepage provides riders with the weather conditions for a given location and clothing advise to match the forecast. The functionality is custom built by Luke, using a weather API combined with custom data provided by Albion.

For the mailing list we choose Mailchimp for its generous free tier and ease of use. Mailchimp capturures email addresses for the Albion mailing list and is used to manage email marketing campaigns, sent weekly to subscribers. Mailchimp is a good option for new businesses who are growing a list and want to send campaigns for free.

## Project learnings

We have learnt a huge amount about process and collaboration through our ongoing partnership with Albion. We continue to work closely with the team to solve new problems as the brand grows. 

I’d like to highlight 4 areas that have had the biggest impact in the success of the project.

**Research and strategy are integral**
Research produces desired results. The primary goal is to identify both the business objectives and problems and come up with a design that solves these things. Good design and development is built on an understanding of what’s required and a knowledge of the best technologies to make it happen. 

**Effect collaboration is powerful**
When working in a small team, communication is vital between everyone involved from the start. Engaging developers in the stage of ideation is vital to the success of the project.

**Seek feedback throughout the project**
Keeping everyone in the loop at every stage of the process is vital to the success of the project. The more feedback gathered, the easier and faster it is to create the right product.

**Iteration is inevitable**
It’s impossible to solve every problem first time round, and inevitably new features will be required. Websites are dynamic products and this one is no exception.

## Key findings

Albion have come along way since we launched the site and now have an active group of riders who regularly buy products and engage with the content the team creates. Here are some key facts and figures to outline their journey since launch.
