I'm here to help you bring your project to life. If you're aiming to grow your business online I can help you in a number of ways:

- **Evaluate your business goals** and make a solid plan of action.
- **Build a website** which you can manage.
- Create a strategy to **find more clients and increase your revenue**.
- Optimise your current website to **increase customer conversions**.
- **Build and market your product** to the right audience.


## How we can work together

It can be a big decision choosing who you work with to build your business. In all honesty, there are many ways you can grow your business yourself — you don't always need to spend a ton of money on fancy design consultancy.

That being said, going it alone isn't necessarily for everyone, in which case you might want to work with someone like me.

### Design strategy: Report

We'll discuss* your business objectives in depth, analysing your goals and identify both your strengths and weaknesses. Together we will formulate a plan of action for your online presence.

I will then write a detailed 1,000+ word report on how  best to grow your business online.

_*This can take place via Skype or in person_.

### Marketing: Landing page and mailing list

If you have a product or an idea for one, then it's time to show the world and collect some data. This is the first step in building an audience and measuring interest.

I'll design and build **a simple one page landing page** and set you up with **a mailing list**, so you can collect emails. You'll be all set to follow up new leads and start converting customers.  

### Bespoke: Design & code

Do you need **a bespoke Wordpress site** (that's your very own unique theme built from scratch) or perhaps **a way to sell your products online**? Maybe you just need something simple like **a static site**.

Whatever it may be, if you want full control of your website and your user experience, then I can design and build a full website experience for you and your audience.
