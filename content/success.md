Forgive me if I don’t reply right away, I usually only check my inbox once a day to avoid distraction. I’ll get back to you within 24hrs.

In the meantime, I have some bits I’d like to share with you: 

1. Check out [secure, privacy focused email](/writing/privacy-focused-email/) if you want to learn more about my email set up.
2. Find out why I’m [De-Googling](/writing/de-googling/) and what tools I’m using instead.
3. Learn how to [automate your newsletter with RSS](/writing/automating-newsletter-posse-rss/).
4. If you’re interested in learning Hugo, I have a whole bunch of [Hugo articles](/topics/hugo/) which should keep you busy. I’m also working on a course over at [Practicalhugo.com](https://practicalhugo.com/).


Oh, and one more thing... if you’re here to test how this form works, then make sure you read [Handling forms on static sites with Netlify](/articles/forms-with-netlify/) to learn how to set one up for yourself.
