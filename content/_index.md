I design and code fast, lightweight, content-based websites, mainly using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

I also write about [building performant websites](/writing/) using popular tools like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

I curate [a monthly newsletter](/newsletter/) for front-end web developers who are interested in [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) technology and generally keeping it simple.
