I design and code fast, accessible, content-based websites, mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

On this website I mostly write about [building static websites with Hugo](/topics/hugo/), [improving privacy and security online](/topics/privacy/)  and the [tools I use](/uses/), day to day.

Once a month I curate [a newsletter for web designs and developers](/newsletter/) interested in static sites, web performance, privacy and sustainability.

I’m currently working on [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) – a course about building resilient websites with Hugo.
