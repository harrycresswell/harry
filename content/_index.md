I write [articles on design and code](/articles/) and curate [a weekly newsletter](/newsletter/) for designers and front-end web developers. I also keep [notes on things I’m learning](/notes/) from books, courses and interesting things I find from various places on the internet.

Currently I live between London and Hamburg, where I work with a handful of clients. In my free time I enjoy running, climbing, hiking and skiing. I practice yoga and meditation most mornings.
