{{< intro >}}Hey, I’m Harry, a freelance designer and front-end web developer based in London, England.{{< /intro >}}

{{< pullImage src="v1550264713/hc/harry-cresswell-about-me.jpg" alt="Harry Cresswell – Front-end Web Development" caption="" >}}

I design and code fast, lightweight, content-based websites, mainly using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

Here I write about [building performant websites](/writing/) using popular tools like [Hugo](/topics/hugo/), [Eleventy](/topics/eleventy/) and [Sanity](/topics/sanity/).

I also curate [a monthly newsletter](/newsletter/) for front-end web developers who like to keep it lean, clean and simple by using [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) technology.
