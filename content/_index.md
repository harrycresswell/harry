I design and code fast, lightweight, content-based websites, mainly using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

I also write about [building performant websites](/writing/) using popular tools like [Hugo](/topics/hugo/), [Eleventy](/topics/eleventy/) and [Sanity](/topics/sanity/).

I curate [a monthly newsletter](/newsletter/) for front-end web developers who are interested in using [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) technology and generally like to keep it lean, clean and simple.
