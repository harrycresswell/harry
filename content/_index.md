{{< intro >}}Hey, I’m Harry, a freelance designer and front-end web developer based in London, England.{{< /intro >}}

{{< pullImage src="v1550264713/hc/harry-cresswell-about-me.jpg" alt="Harry Cresswell – Front-end Web Development" caption="" >}}

I design and code fast, accessible, content-based websites, mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

On my blog I write about [building performant websites](/writing/) using popular tools like [Hugo](/topics/hugo/), [Eleventy](/topics/eleventy/) and [Sanity](/topics/sanity/).

Once a month I curate [a newsletter for web designs and developers](/newsletter/) who like to keep it lean, clean and simple, by using [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture.

I’m currently working on [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) – a course about building websites with Hugo and the Jamstack.
