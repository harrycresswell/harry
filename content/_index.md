I design and code fast, accessible, content-based websites, mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

On my blog I write about [building performant websites](/writing/) using popular tools like [Hugo](/topics/hugo/), [Eleventy](/topics/eleventy/) and [Sanity](/topics/sanity/).

Once a month I curate [a newsletter for web designs and developers](/newsletter/) interested in static sites, web performance, privacy and sustainability.

I’m currently working on [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) – a course about building resilient websites with Hugo.

## Where to go next

Read some [client case studies](/topics/case-study/), check out a few [things I’ve built](/things) or [books I’ve read](/reading). Maybe take a look at [my CV](pdf/harry-cresswell-cv-aug-21.pdf) to learn more about my experience. 

Learn more about [how I built this site](/build/), check out [the tools I use](/uses/) on a daily basis or find out [what I'm up to right now](/now/).
