I design and code fast, accessible, content-based websites, mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

On my blog I write about [building performant websites](/writing/) using popular tools like [Hugo](/topics/hugo/), [Eleventy](/topics/eleventy/) and [Sanity](/topics/sanity/).

Once a month I curate [a newsletter for web designs and developers](/newsletter/) who like to keep it lean, clean and simple, by using [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture.

## Where to go next

Check out some [recent client case studies](/topics/case-study/) or take a look at [my CV](pdf/harry-cresswell-cv-aug-21.pdf) to learn more about my experience.

Read about [how I built this site](/build/) to learn about the techniques I tend to use. Find out [what I'm up to right now](/now/) or check out [the tools I use](/uses/) on a daily basis.
