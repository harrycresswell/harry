Thanks for your message. It’s flying through the internet right now.

Forgive me if I don’t reply right away, I receive a lot of messages so I tend to pause my inbox to limit distraction from email to once per day. I aim to get back to everyone within 24hrs.

P.S. — If you’re here to check out how this form works and you want to know more about building forms on static sites read my article [Handling forms on static sites with Netlify](/articles/forms-with-netlify/).
