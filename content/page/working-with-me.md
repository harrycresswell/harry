{{< intro >}}Here are a few ideas of how we can work together and whether I’m the right fit for your next project.{{< /intro >}}

My name is Harry Cresswell, I’m an independent designer and front-end web developer from London, England. I’ve spent the last 8 years helping startups and independent individuals set up online.

## What I do

From early stage concepts through to product lauch, I wireframe, prototype and code content based websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I specialise in creating [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) websites from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and eCommerce stores using [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). I am well versed in content modeling and creating content management systems using [Forestry](https://forestry.io/), [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

I tend to build clean, simple websites, with a focus on typography. I don’t belive in overcomplicating things. Expect a performant, robust website which is quick to load and cost effective to run.

## What I don’t do

I can’t help you build an IOS or Andriod app, or anything powered by user driven data. It’s not my focus and I won’t do a good job of it.

If you want a highly illustrative design or something heavy on animation, then I’m probably not the right person either.

If you’re looking to tweak an existing theme, you need help with your Squarespace or Wix site then I’m not your guy. There was a time, but that time has now past.

If your brief is vague and you aren’t prepared to offer any input or direction, but you’re still expecting to _wow_ your clients, then I suggest looking elsewhere.

## How I work

I believe communication and collaboration are vital to the success of a project. I like to ask a lot of questions and involve clients in every step of product development. That way we’re on the same page from start to finish.

I keep my process dynamic and as fluid as possible. We’ll move thoughtfully and efficiently in the most appropriate direction until we arrive at the solution.

## Who hires me

I work with startups, small independent businesses, agencies and individuals looking for a web developer who has a design background and knows how to turn ideas from design mockups into code.

My clients are keen to execute ideas, but don’t necessarily have the technical skills or time to do so. They would rather invest their budget in good design, at an affordable rate, from an independent designer. Instead of spending big money on agency fees.

## What I charge

My rate varies depending on your situation and needs.

If you’re an independent individual just starting out then I will charge a considerable amount less than if you are an established business or you’ve just raised investment. If you’re a non-profit organisation or charity then I will often waiver my fee entirely.

I charge a flat fee for all projects, so no hourly rate, just a single project price.

## Get in touch

If you have a project in mind, and you think I might be a good fit, then [let’s talk about it](/contact/) and we can take it from there.
