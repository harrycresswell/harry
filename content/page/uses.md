My office setup and the app and services I use day to day, inspired by the great [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses/).

## Home office

In 2022 I switched to the [MacBookPro M1 14”](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro-14-and-16/), after my 15” MacBook Pro (Mid 2015) finally gave out. The M1 is a beast. I haven’t heard the fans spin once since making the switch. I went for the base model which is more than enough for my needs.

My laptop sits on a [Roost Laptop Stand](https://www.therooststand.com/), which I cannot recommend highly enough. I picked mine up during the Kickstarter, so it’s an early model, but it doesn’t seem like they’ve changed much since then. It’s strong, collapsible and super light, so you can take it everywhere.

I’ve been using an [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLA22B/A/magic-keyboard-british-english) and [Apple Magic Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ2R2Z/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver) combo for years now, and I’m happy with both. 

My [Dell P2415Q Monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/inch-Dell-P2415Q-IPS-Monitor/dp/B00QAJ2MOM/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Dell+P2415Q&qid=1584572080&sr=8-1) I don’t have much of an opinion about. It’s certainy not the best out there, but it gets the job done.

I’ve had [Logitech x-230 speakers](https://www.ebay.co.uk/i/333518493626?chn=ps) since what feels like the beginning of time. I remember using them when I made music at university back in 2006. They’re still going strong and kick out a good bit of bass, so I’ve stuck with them.

My phone is an [Apple iPhone X](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/). I’m not much into phones, so I have no plans to upgrade any time soon.

My [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) were a more recent purchase, and I only have good things to say–one of the best Apple product releases in a good while.

I work at a [606 Universal Shelving System Desk Shelf](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/606/components#desk-shelf). This the most expensive piece of furniture I own, but I use it everyday, so it was well worth the price. 

I sit on a [Herman Miller Aeron Chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) which I found on eBay for a decent price.

## Design

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is my go-to UI design tool, but these days I find myself using it for all sorts of design related work. However, I recently discovered an open-source competitor called [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) which I plan to test out for personal projects.

[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) has replaced Photoshop as my choice for photo editing and creating raster based graphics. Affinity software is fast, intuitive to learn and you can’t beat the one-off payment vs monthly subscription.

[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) and [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/) are also installed on my machine. I use these two apps less so than Photo, but they’re handy to have for vector illustration and creating print assets, respectively.

[Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com) is my choice for designing typefaces and icons. It’s super intuitive and a lot of fun to use.

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)** has a feature called Trace Bitmap which does a great job of replacing Adobe Illustrator’s Live Trace, so this is what I use it for.

Learn about [the tools I used to build this website](/build/).

## Privacy and security

I use [Simplelogin](https://simplelogin.io/) to generate email aliases for all the accounts I create. If you’re new to email aliases, I’ve written all about it in [Masking email](/writing/masking-email/).

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)** is my prefered password manager and I’ve tried many over the years. It integrates nicely with SimpleLogin, which means I can generate email aliases, along with passwords, from directly within the app.

I have [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) set up to open at login. If my laptop is on, then NordVPN is running. It masks my IP, protects me from trackers and malware, and when on public Wi-Fi. 

[Signal](https://www.signal.org)** is the open source messaging app we should probably all be using.

I made the switch from Dropbox to [Sync](https://www.sync.com/) at the beginning of 2021 after researching secure, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage providers.

I switched from Google Workspace to [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)** at the beginning of 2022 and haven’t looked back. I wrote about my experience with Tutanota in [Secure, privacy focused email](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/privacy-focused-email/). I also use Tutanota’s encrypted Calendar.

[Raivo OTP](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raivo-otp/id1459042137)** is a fantastic open source authenticator app which I use to generate one-time passwords. It seemlessly handles back up and sync across iOS and MacOS devices.

[Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si)** is a fantastic open source encrypted tool for video calls. You don’t need an account to use it which is a plus.

[Tresorit Send](https://send.tresorit.com) is brilliant for sending big files, end-to-end encrypted.

[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) is a lightweight anti-malware and virus removal software which will perform a daily scan of your system to keep it protected.

## Reading

[NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com)** for RSS. If that doesn’t mean much to you then think of it as curating your own feed of content from people or websites that you want to follow – but without some dumb algorithm controlling how you receive content. It’s chronological and super simple.

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) and [Reader](https://readwise.io/read) are quickly becoming my favourite two tools. I use the former to save highlights form eBooks and articles, which are then   rolled up in a daily review. The latter I use as a “read it later” app–for saving long form content, though it can also be used as an RSS reader.

I’ve recently started using the [Kindle](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/kindle/id302584613) app to read ebooks when I’m not with my [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-paperwhite-8-gb-now-with-a-68-display-and-adjustable-warm-light-with-ads/dp/B08N3TCP2F).


## Writing

[Typora](https://typora.io) allows you to write markdown in preview, so it feels more like working in Google Docs and less like a code editor. Typora has a great outline panel which helps you structure your articles. These days I’ll create a markdown post with Hugo, then open it in Typora and work on the content from there. Before now I would have composes drafts elsewhere, then copy them across to Hugo. This new approach is seamless and allows you to version control your work.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is my note taking tool of choice. I’m not yet using it to it’s full potential as a second brain, but it‘s something I plan on working on in the future. I’ve recently started using it for journaling, too. Using the Daily notes plugin which spins up a new daily note from a template, when I launch the app each morning.

I use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) with caution. It’s helpful for picking up typos, bad grammar and so on, but use it too much and it strips the personality from your writing.

[Hemmingway](https://hemingwayapp.com) I find helpful for cleaning up lengthy sentances and spotting passive voice.

## Project management

I’ve been using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as a project management for a number of years. I use [the P.A.R.A method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) to manage its flexibility. I also use it as a general bookmarking tool, by saving web pages using the Notion Web Clipper. My final use for Notion is for tracking health related things like running, meditation, workouts and so on.

[PandaDoc](https://www.pandadoc.com/) is great for collection e-signatures on proposals and work agreements. I like to design these docs in Figma, then upload them to PandaDoc to collect the signature. It’s a nice feature which means you don’t have to use a pre-built template.

[Screenity](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screenity-screen-recorder/kbbdabhdfibnancpjfhlkhafgdilcnji?ref=producthunt) is a great tool for async video communication. Record quick videos via a browser extension, get a link to the video and share the URL with clients or colleagues. It’s a great way to get out of unecessary meetings.

[Kap](https://getkap.co/)** is my screen capture tool of choice.


## Finance

I use [Starling](https://www.starlingbank.com/referral?code=rkNWmT)* for my business bank account.

I use [Freeagent](http://fre.ag/44clni8a)* for accounting and have done for a number of years. My accountant uses it too, which makes the process straight forward. If you run your own business and you’re not using a digital accounting tool, then I highly recommend looking into one.

I use [Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/harryc454)* to collect international payments from clients abroad. With Wise you can set up a local bank account and receive payments much faster than with a domestic bank account.

## Misc

[Numi](https://numi.app/) is my go-to calculator app. It looks and feels more like a terminal and you can write commands in a natural way. For example: “1 inch in cm” will return `1 inch in cm`.

[Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/) is a great little app that helps you stay focused by allowing you to mix and match different background sounds. I use the iOS version mainly, but there’s also a web app.

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)** is an application window manager that helps you neatly resize and organise open windows using keyboard shortcuts.

[Maccy](https://maccy.app)** I discovered recently. It keeps a history of all the things you’ve copied to your clipboard to make them easier to access. Very handy, particularly for web development.

- [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/) is a handy tool for finding large files and freeing up space on your machine.

I’ve been using [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for my mailing list for years, however these days it often feels overkill for my needs. With that said, I decided to give [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) a go for the Practical Hugo mailing list – only positive things to say so far.

I use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) mainly to send emails to myself reminding me to do things that only happen periodically. Things like updating masked email addresses or sending out my newsletter. I also use [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), mostly to pass form submissions to a spreadsheet.

[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) is the tool I use to handle online payments for things like fonts or themes. 

I also use [Buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) for donations.
