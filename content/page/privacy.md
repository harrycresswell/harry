In compliance with UK data and privacy laws (“GDPR”) and in an effort to be more transparent, I have assembled the following information about the data I collect on this website, how I handle it and what I do to help ensure the privacy of visitors.

## What data I collect

From this website, I collect the name and email address of those who sign up for [my newsletter](/newsletter/) using the form at the bottom of each page. I also collect the name, email address and message of anyone who contacts me via my [contact](/contact/) page.

**This websites does not use tracking cookies**, meaning I have no way to identify or track you if you simply browse the site and do not share your data with me, via any of the methods listed above. You can check for yourself by typing https://harrycresswell.com into [Cookiemetrix](https://www.cookiemetrix.com/).

Similarly, **this website does not use analytics** of any kind to track visitors.

## What I do with data

The data I collect via my newsletter sign up form is stored in my [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/features/landing-pages/) account and used for the sole purpose of sending newsletters. I only email people who have genuinely signed up to receive my newsletters. I have no intention of selling your data to any third party data brokers.

The data I collect from my contact page is stored by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), who send me a notification via email when a submision has been received. I use this data for correspondence with the contact via email. Should the contact become a client, then I may use this data to process invoices using [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com/), my accounting software.

## How I keep your data safe

I use [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to randomly generate and store a 28-character password for my Mailchimp, Netlify and FreeAgent accounts. I also use [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) (2FA) in order to keep the accounts as safe from hacks as possible. 

With Mailchimp, I use [double opt-in](https://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/single-opt-in-vs.-double-opt-in) during the sign up process to prevent spam accounts and include an unsubscribe link on every email I send out.

_⚠️ While I take the security of your personal data extremely seriously, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security, particularly from third party data breaches._

## If you have any concerns

Please [contact me](https://harrycresswell.com/contact), as soon as possible, if you have any concerns about how your data is being handled or would like me to destroy it.
