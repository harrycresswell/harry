In compliance with the data and privacy laws (“GDPR”), effective of May 25th 2018 and in an effort to be more transparent with those who who choose to share data with me, I have assembled the following information.

## What data I collect

From this website I collect the name and email address of those who sign up for [my newsletter](/newsletter/) and/or contact me via my [contact](/contact/) page.

I also keep the full name and business address of clients I work with. This is usually collected through email correspondence.

I do not collect cookies, use Google Analytics or any other tracking software on this website.

## What I do with data

The data I collect via my newsletter sign up form is used for the sole purpose of sending newsletters. I only email people who have genuinely signed up to receive my newsletters. I have no intention of selling you anything, advertising or passing your data on to any 3rd party services.

Data I collect from clients is used for communication and accounting purposes only.

## How I keep your data safe

I store data in my [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/features/landing-pages/) account. I use a generated password from [1Password](https://1password.com/) and [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) (2FA) in order to keep it as safe as possible.

I use [double opt-in](https://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/single-opt-in-vs.-double-opt-in) during the sign up process to prevent spam accounts and include an unsubscribe link on every email I send out.

Client data is kept in my FreeAgent accounting software.

The security of your personal data is important, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
