## Side projects

[Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com) is a course about building resilient websites with Hugo & the Jamstack. I’m in the process of putting together and if all goes to plan it will launch in Spring 2022.

[Local London](https://locallondon.life) is a directory of London food & drink suppliers who deliver to your door. I’m working on the project with my friend Rozzy in response to the Covid-19 lockdown, to help support local Londoners and local suppliers.

[Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) is a small type foundry I set up in 2017 with a focus on hand drawn type and imperfection in type design.

[Dark Sky](https://soundcloud.com/dark-sky) is an electronic music project by Matt Benyayer. Since 2012 Matt and I have collaborated on artwork for most releases. You’ll find the music and artwork on [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/harrycresswell).

## Tools

[instagram-hugo](https://github.com/harrycresswell/instagram-hugo). A simple demo site showing how to create an Instagram feed on a Hugo website using [Profile Page Images Loader](https://profilepageimages.usecue.com/) by Joost van der Schee.

[Design tokens and styleguides with Eleventy](https://github.com/harrycresswell/design-tokens-eleventy). A simple workflow showing you how to use Eleventy and NPM Scripts to take YAML design tokens and generate a styleguide and CSS Custom properties.

[Mood](https://mood.harrycresswell.com/) is a visual aid for creative projects – a moodboard of things I like. None of the content is my own. Built with Hugo, hosted with Netlify.

## Past

[Remote Cards](https://remote.cards/) is a fun card generator tool for promoting live streaming events. I built this with my brother [Ben](https://benmclaren.xyz/) during the first week of the Covid-19 lockdown.

[In Detail](https://indtl.com/). An engagememnt ring concierge service which started life as a jewellery blog. I co-founded the project back in 2011, with [Beanie Major](http://blake-ldn.com/journal/2016/11/8/blake-woman-beanie-major).
