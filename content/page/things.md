[Local London](https://locallondon.life) is a directory of London food & drink suppliers who deliver to your door. I’m working on the project with my friend Rozzy in response to the Covid-19 lockdown, to help support local Londoners and local suppliers.

[Remote Cards](https://remote.cards/) is a fun card generator tool for promoting live streaming events. I built this with my brother [Ben](https://benmclaren.xyz/) during the first week of the Covid-19 lockdown.

[Albion Cycling](http://www.albioncycling.com/). A Wordpress build with custom theme, Shopify integration and custom weather app. I designed the site in collaboration with [Luke Harvey](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/). [Read the full case study](/projects/albion/) to find out the process.
