[Local London](https://locallondon.life) is a directory of London food & drink suppliers who deliver to your door. I’m working on the project with my friend Rozzy in response to the Covid-19 lockdown, to help support local Londoners and local suppliers.

[Remote Cards](https://remote.cards/) is a fun card generator tool for promoting live streaming events. I built this with my brother [Ben](https://benmclaren.xyz/) during the first week of the Covid-19 lockdown.

[Albion Cycling](http://www.albioncycling.com/). A Wordpress build with custom theme, Shopify integration and custom weather app. I designed the site in collaboration with [Luke Harvey](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/). [Read the full case study](/projects/albion/) to find out the process.

[AIN Jobs](https://jobs.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk). A Gatsby site which generates it’s content directly from markdown files. Simple as it gets with Gatsby and React.

[SeedTribe Hub](https://hub.seedtribe.com/). An Impact focused content site built in React using Gatsby. The data layer makes use of [Sanity](/tags/sanity/), an API based headless CMS. This project is currently a work in progress.

[Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) is a small type foundry I set up in 2017 with a focus on hand drawn type and imperfection in type design.

[Mood](https://mood.harrycresswell.com/) is is a visual aid for creative projects – a moodboard of things I like. None of the content is my own. Built with Hugo, hosted with Netlify.
