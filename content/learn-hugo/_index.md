Welcome the humble beginnings of my course on building websites with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

Currently a work in progress, my aim is to share entire process through [daily updates](#course-updates). If you’d like to join me on this journey you can [subscribe to updates via RSS](/updates/feed.xml).

I plan on publishing each chapter of the course on this page as I write it. If you would like to receive a copy of each chapter in your inbox when it goes live, then please [sign up for course content by email](#signup) . Alternatively, you can [subscribe to course content via RSS](/learn-hugo/feed.xml) and have all course material sent to your RSS reader of choice.

I don’t have much information about the course yet as it’s still early days, no more than an intention at this stage. What I can tell you is I’m giving myself 3-6 months to write it. This seems like a reasonable amount of time given my other work commitments. I aim to set a hard deadline soon, but you can expect the final course to **launch sometime in Spring 2022**.
