> ”We worked with Harry when we launched our brand. He absolutely understood the brief and the need to use the digital space to create a functioning and inspiring brand world. Among many things, he designed a bespoke weather app implementation to our homepage that we still get asked about years later. He was incredibly interested in and clear about how to future-proof the site, and the changes that would likely occur in the future to the digital world. It was a pleasure to work with someone so knowledgeable, communicative and effective.”

> “I’ve worked with Harry on three different websites over the past five years. Before Harry I had built some websites myself and hired several other web designers on previous sites. Harry has been one of the best people I’ve worked with in any field. He’s the rare deal: a real digital craftsman.”
