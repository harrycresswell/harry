He is also passionate about building websites in the right way, keeping performance, accessibility, privacy, security and web standards top of mind. It was a real pleasure to collaborate with him on several projects earlier in my career and I continue to be proud of the work we completed together.”

> ”We worked with Harry when we launched our brand. He absolutely understood the brief and the need to use the digital space to create a functioning and inspiring brand world. Among many things, he designed a bespoke weather app implementation to our homepage that we still get asked about years later. He was incredibly interested in and clear about how to future-proof the site, and the changes that would likely occur in the future to the digital world. It was a pleasure to work with someone so knowledgeable, communicative and effective.”
