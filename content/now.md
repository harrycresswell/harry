Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about) (who started the thing) and everyone else on the Indie Web – these are the things I’m focusing my time and energy on right now.

## Building

- A website for a recently rebranded solar company based in Virgina, USA.
- [cu.css](https://cu.harrycresswell.com), a lightweight CSS framework built with [Cube CSS](https://cube.fyi/) and [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/).
- [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/), a project based course teaching you how to build websites with Hugo. 
- [Eryn](https://studioeryn.com/), my studio website.

## Writing

- The Practical Hugo curriculum. It’s taking me forever to write alongside work commitments, but I’ll get there eventually.
- Copywriting the Eryn website. I figured it was about time to separate work and my personal website. That way I can write about whatever I want here.

## Watching

- Big Little Lies.
- Nearing the end of The X-Files season 2. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to watch all 11 seasons. This could take a while.
- Almost finished The Clone Wars season 2.

## Reading

- [Sekret Machines: A Fire Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39798154-a-fire-within) by Tom Delonge and AJ Hartley
- [What is simple web design?](https://anthonyhobday.com/books/simpledesign/) by Anthony Hobday 

## Learning

- How to [Visualise Value](https://visualizevalue.com/).
- How to set up my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, inspired by [Steph Ango’s vault](https://stephango.com/vault)
- Chris Ferdinandi’s [Vanilla JavaScript pocket guides](https://vanillajsguides.com/)
- 10mins a day of German using Duolingo.
