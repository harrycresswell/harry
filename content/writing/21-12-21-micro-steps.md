Feels like I’m making micro steps at the moment, but I’m heading in the right direction.

I added a sign up form to [practicalhugo.com](https://practicalhugo.com), then spontaneously ditched Mailchimp in favour of Buttondown for the email list – hopefully this doesn’t turn out to be a bad decision. I know Mailchimp pretty well, which is why I tend to stick with it, but as they add new features it’s starting to feel like overkill for my basic needs.

On the other hand, [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) seems super simple and you can write emails in markdown – exactly what I’m looking for. I only hear positive things from those who use it, and this new project is a great chance to take it for a spin. 

So far I’ve managed to hook the form up to my new list. Tomorrow I’ll clean up the automated sign up emails, work on a some kind of welcome email and dig further into the docs. 

That’s it for today. Time to make some dinner then get those presents wrapped.
