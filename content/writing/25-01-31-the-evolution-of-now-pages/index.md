It was interesting to read about [the evolution of Robb’s /now page](https://rknight.me/blog/on-transient-slash-pages/). How he’s moving away from a transient, impersonal page of data towards something more meaningful. 

On a related note, I completely agree with [Chris’ thoughts on slash pages](https://chriscoyier.net/2025/01/04/slash-pages/). I found myself nodding along in agreement, to these few lines in particular:

> “I think it makes more sense to me to write about what I carry around _right now_ and if I did it again later, it doesn’t have to replace what I’ve written before. It would be interesting and worth preserving each time.”

On [ShopTalkShow episode 647](https://shoptalkshow.com/647/), Chris shares another concern he has with slash pages. How does anyone ever see them if they aren’t syndicated (for example via RSS)? It’s true, they’d be far more visible as blog posts. 

I’ve been keeping [my own /now page](/now/) since 2017. I’ve made countless updates to it since then. Now I think about it, it’s a real shame there’s no record of what I wrote previously. If you had nothing better to do and were really that interested, then I suppose you could trawl through my Github commits. But who in their right mind could be bothered to do that?

This brings me to [Zinzy’s /now page](https://www.zinzy.website/now/), which I’m a big fan of. What I like most about it is that it feels as if you’re getting a quick glimpse into what’s happening in Zinzy’s life, at that particular moment. I like how each update is organised by date and how previous updates are preserved as an archive - just like how a regular blog works.

It would be fun to try something similar with my own /now page. Make it feel more like a bunch of quick journal entries. This approach definitely makes the whole now page thing way more personal and interesting. 

In my head, I picture myself posting these updates from a chairlift in the Alps. Or whilst out on a hike with friends. Perhaps I’m overestimating how interesting my day-to-day life actually is. I suppose we’ll find out soon enough. Whatever the case, with the demise of Big Social, it feels like the right sort of time to make this happen.

I expect the key to making it work is figuring out a simple system that makes posting these “now” updates as frictionless as possible. Realistically, that’s the only way I’m likely stick with it, but I guarantee that’s easier said than done. 

Before I get deep in the weeds with that, the first step is to change how my /now page functions. Make it act more like a blog, and less like a boring transient page which rarely gets updated.
