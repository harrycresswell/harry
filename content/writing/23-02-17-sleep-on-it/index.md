Let me sleep on it – my go-to response when struggling to find solutions.

I love this expression. It reminds me that a solution will invariably present itself when you’re well rested and a problem has been given satisfactory time and space. It also gives the recipient an idea of when you may have an answer. Win win. 

It seems absurd to write a note about such a simple idea, but it’s easy to forget the importance of sleep, time and space. With very little effort, these three tools combine to give you a fresh perspective on things. And, ultimately, help you to identify the most appropriate way to move forward.  

I rarely give these tools enough credit, particularly when it comes to work.
