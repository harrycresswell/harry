When struggling to find a solution I often say to clients; “let me sleep on it”.

I love this expression. It reminds me that a solution will invariably present itself when you’re well rested and you’ve given a problem time and space. It also gives the client an idea about when you may have an answer. 

It seems absurd to write about such a simple idea, but it’s easy to forget the importance of sleep, time and space. With very little effort, these three tools combine to give you a fresh perspective on things and, ultimately, help you identify the best way to move forward.  

I rarely give these tools enough credit. Particularly when it comes to work.
