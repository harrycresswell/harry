It’s interesting and perhaps encouraging to see folks declaring their work *AI free* or *human-generated*, in some way or another.

Jared White has pledged that [everything his web design studio creates will be 100% AI free](https://www.whitefusion.studio/#stop-publicizing-progress-without-committing-to-ethics) going forward:

> **Our pledge to you in 2024 and beyond:** 100% ==AI-free== productions. All the solutions we provide are of the finest ==human-grade quality==. We’re not afraid of _progress_! But we’re not buying the _bullshit_. Read more about our [AI Ethical Framework](https://www.whitefusion.studio/ai-ethics) we’ve laid out which presents the minimum threshold required for us to evaluate any “generative AI” toolchain.

[Venkatram](https://vhbelvadi.com/) has taken another approach, by adding the following statement to the footer of his website:

> Climate friendly and completely AI-free.

[Not by AI](https://notbyai.fyi/) takes this idea a step further by offering a “produced by a human” badge that you can add to your work. You’ll qualify as long as your work isn‘t generated by AI or at least 90% of it is created by humans.

> “Not By AI badges are created to encourage more humans to produce original content and help users identify human-generated content.” 

According the the [Not by AI](https://notbyai.fyi/) website, this is important because:

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is trained using human-created content. If humans stop producing new content and rely solely on AI, online content across the world may become repetitive and stagnant.

Personally, I’m not sure where I’m at with the whole generative AI thing. On the one hand the statement above seems to make a lot of sense. But then there’s the argument that AI will simply augment human creativity just like any other creative tool, rather than stagnate it. I suppose it depends on the degree to which we embrace it. 

Whatever the case, I feel I need to educate myself more before I wade in with any generative AI tools. Jared’s [AI Ethical Framework](https://www.whitefusion.studio/ai-ethics) seems like a good place to start.

For now, I’m right behind this “AI free” movement and what it stands for. 

I like doing difficult things that take time and effort – like using your fallible head and hands to create original work. Ultimately, it must be more rewarding than letting some AI tool do most the hard work. So why not state proudly that your work was created without the assistance of AI. Perhaps I’ll do the same on my website, too.

Anyway, it will be interesting to see whether this “AI free” trend continue to grow. If it does, then I’ll return to this post to document more examples, as I find them.
