It’s encouraging to see folks declaring their work *AI free* or *human-generated*, in some form or another.

Jared White has pledged that [everything his web design studio creates will be 100% AI free](https://www.whitefusion.studio/#stop-publicizing-progress-without-committing-to-ethics) going forward:

> **Our pledge to you in 2024 and beyond:** 100% ==AI-free== productions. All the solutions we provide are of the finest ==human-grade quality==. We’re not afraid of _progress_! But we’re not buying the _bullshit_. Read more about our [AI Ethical Framework](https://www.whitefusion.studio/ai-ethics) we’ve laid out which presents the minimum threshold required for us to evaluate any “generative AI” toolchain.

[Venkatram](https://vhbelvadi.com/) has taken another approach, by adding the following statement to the footer of his website:

> Climate friendly and completely AI-free.

[Annie Sturdivant](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/) has done something similar, also adding a statement in the footer of her website:

> Handcrafted by a human.

[Not by AI](https://notbyai.fyi/) takes this idea a step further by offering a “produced by a human” badge that you can add to your work. You’ll qualify as long as your work isn‘t generated by AI or at least 90% of it is created by humans.

> “Not By AI badges are created to encourage more humans to produce original content and help users identify human-generated content.” 

According the the [Not by AI](https://notbyai.fyi/) website, this is important because:

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is trained using human-created content. If humans stop producing new content and rely solely on AI, online content across the world may become repetitive and stagnant.


I’m right behind this “AI free” idea and what it stands for. 

I like doing difficult things that take time and effort. There’s no better feeling than using your fallible head and hands to create original work. Ultimately, it’s rewarding. It’s honest work. Work to be proud of. 

Can the same be said of the garbage that some generative AI tool spat out for you in a matter of seconds?

Anyway, I hope to see this “AI free” trend continue to grow. I’ll return to this post to document more examples, as I find them.
