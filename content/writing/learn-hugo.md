Welcome the humble beginnings of my course on building websites with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

Currently a work in progress, my aim is to share entire process through [daily updates](/topics/hugo-course/). If you’d like to join me on this journey you can [subscribe via RSS](/writing/feed.xml).

I plan on publishing each chapter of the course on this page as I write it. If you would like to receive a copy of each chapter in your inbox when it goes live, then please [sign up for course content by email](https://practicalhugo.com/).

I don’t have much information about the course yet as it’s still early days, no more than an intention at this stage. What I can tell you is I’m giving myself 3-6 months to write it. This seems like a reasonable amount of time given my other work commitments.
