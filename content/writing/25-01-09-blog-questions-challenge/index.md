Thought I’d give the Blog Questions Challenge a go, having seen [Kev](https://kevquirk.com/blog/blog-questions-challenge), [Luke](https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2025/blog-questions-challenge/) and [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-questions-challenge) share theirs.

I’m also not on Bear Blog, so I’m using the questions Kev adapted from [Ava’s original ones](https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/) for my own.


## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

Around 2017, I started taking notes on the design and web dev stuff I was learning. Mostly so I had something to refer back to when I forgot what I’d learnt. Around the same time, I read Shawn’s post [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) or one similar, I can’t quite remember. Following that, it seemed sensible to publish these notes as posts on my site. 

Through the process I discovered that I quite enjoyed writing – how it helps you slow down and deepen your understanding of the things you’re writing about – so I kept it going. I realised this doesn’t just apply to technical posts, but also writing about life in general. That’s when I started posting about various other topics.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

I chose Hugo because I wanted to use a simple, open-source tool, that required minimal maintenance and that I could stick with long-term. 

What I love about Hugo is that it’s pretty much just Markdown files and a few basic templates. It doesn’t get much simpler than that. You don’t need any extra dependencies to run a Hugo site, so they can be super easy to maintain. I’ve used Hugo for the past 8 years and have no plans on switching anytime soon.

I chose Netlify because it was one of the few options I knew of at the time, that could deploy a site from commits pushed to a Github repository. It was also super easy to set up and cost nothing. There may well be a bunch of better options these days, but I haven’t had any issues yet, so I’ve stuck with it.


## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Way back when I took more photos I used a bunch of different tools, like [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Koken](https://www.koken.me/) and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).

I had a brief spell using Medium, but since I’ve been writing I’ve mostly used Hugo.

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?

These days all my posts start life in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I create a new note, then add my post template. The template adds some front matter to help organise the note, when I’m done with it later.

For more general posts, I tend to just hammer out some words. For technical posts, I usually get a rough outline down first, then expand on that.

Most of this happens at my desk, but Obsidian is synced with my other devices via iCloud, so I can also work on posts from my iPhone when I’m on the move. 

Once I have a rough draft, I’ll read through it, make edits and check for any obvious mistakes. Once I’m happy with it, I open the local copy of my site using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Then I create a new markdown file and copy and paste the markdown from Obsidian into the new file. Next I run the local server and read through it in a browser.

When I look at a post in a browser, I usually spot a bunch more ways to improve it. I make these changes in VS Code.


## When do you feel most inspired to write?

Usually in the mornings, when I have a fresh head. 

Often I’ll think of something I want to write about when I’m out for a run or in the shower. Or when I find a post in [my RSS reader](https://netnewswire.com/) and I feel like I have something to say about it. These posts often end up on [my links page](/links/).

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

I tend to publish the day after I’ve written something. I like to read through a post the following morning, with a fresh pair of eyes. Then make some final edits, before pushing it live.

I often go back to posts I’ve already published. Usually the day after. I always seem to find a ton of ways to improve a post, as I read through the live version.

## What's your favourite post on your blog?

[Menus in Hugo](/writing/menus-in-hugo/), because it’s the one most people have contacted me about or thanked me for. 

Or [OKR in Obsidian](/writing/okr-in-obsidian/), because it’s the one that’s had the biggest impact on how I work.

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

No plans to switch platforms or take on a full-blown redesign. I mostly just chip away at it and try to make small incremental improvements.

I do have a few things on my todo list though:

- Adding an about page
- Adding a bookmarks page
- Adding a photos section
- Adding a graveyard for dead projects

I tend to move at a sloth-like pace, but hopefully I can tackle these things in 2025.
