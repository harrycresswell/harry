Mornings are generally dark and gloomy here in the UK, at this time of year. It’s never easy getting up and out for a run. I’ve become somewhat of a fair-weather runner in recent years. If there’s any chance of rain, I tend to sack it off altogether, roll out my mat and do some yoga instead.

This morning, rain seemed inevitable. Overcast, low dark clouds, all the usual signs. It was only a matter of time before a celestial downpour. For whatever reason I decided to brave it anyway. Perhaps the start of a new year has given me some extra motivation.

Within a few minutes of being out there, the wind picked up and, to no surprise, it began to rain. Soon enough it was hammering it down. Thirty seconds later I was completely sodden. 

I usually feel miserable when I’m caught in the rain and soaked to the bone, but today I decided to embrace it instead. 

Not sure exactly why, but I began to imagine what it must be like coming from a place where rain rarely ever falls. How would it feel if this was the first rain you’d felt in years? Or, maybe even your first ever experience of the stuff?

In a word, it must feel *incredible*. 

I spent the final part of my run with this in my mind. Trying to appreciate the cold wet wind and rain beating my body and face. Out there in the elements, totally drenched, it felt amazing. 

I stopped avoiding puddles as I made my way home. In these sorts of conditions, it makes little difference, so I splashed right through them. It felt just like being a kid again. Outside in the rain, jumping in puddles, having the best of times.

I came through the front door, dripping wet, with the biggest smile on my face.

We’re fortunate to have “bad” weather like this in abundance here in the UK. It’s worth trying to appreciate it more.
