There’s nothing worse than finishing work, feeling tired, then having to figure out what to cook for dinner. It’s a real pain and often leads to bad decisions.

I’ve written before about [how I use meal prepping to stay healthy](/writing/sunday-meal-prep/) throughout the week. In a similar vein, today I want to talk about how I go about planning meals, so we never have to think too hard about what to cook during the week.

The key to planning what you eat, I’ve realised, starts by owning a handful of quality cookbooks, which contain healthy, easy-to-cook meals that taste great.

My favourite cookbooks right now are:

- [Flavour by Ottolenghi](https://ottolenghi.co.uk/products/flavour-cookbook)
- [One pot, pan, planet by Anna Jones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43501560-one)
- [Easy Wins by Anna Jones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203017792-easy-wins)
- [The Plant-based Cookbook by Deliciously Ella](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38882366-deliciously-ella)
- [Quick and Easy by Deliciously Ella](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52894119-deliciously-ella-making-plant-based-quick-and-easy)

We usually buy our fruit and veg from the local market on Saturday mornings. So on either Friday evening or Saturday morning, we’ll have a quick look through our cookbooks, then pull out a handful of recipes that we fancy eating the following week. 

Using Apple Notes, one of us will note down the recipe name, the name of the cookbook and page number the recipe can be found on. Then we extract the ingredients for each recipe into Apple Reminders, where we keep a shared shopping list. Currently we do this manually, but you could easily use something like [iPhone’s Live Text feature](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212630), to take a picture of a recipe and have your phone extract the text. Once the ingredients are in our shopping list, we’re ready to head down to the market and grab what we need. 

Each evening, we’ll pick one of the recipes we’ve written down in Apple Notes to cook. Often recipes will serve at least four people, so that leaves us with plenty of leftovers to use for lunch the following day.

What I love about this approach is that it takes the hassle out of figuring out what to eat every night. It’s super efficient too, as you generally only end up buying what you need for the week. No more dealing with forgotten vegetables rotting at the back of the fridge. 

On another note, it makes me wonder why services like Hello Fresh even exist. It’s fun to pick your own recipes and actually leave the house to buy your own ingredients. Just as Manu points out that [friction is important in the digital world](https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-on-the-importance-of-friction), it’s also important in the physical world, too.
