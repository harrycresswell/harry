Woke up this morning to a power cut on our street and no running water.  What else am I’m currently taking for granted, that I would miss if it were gone? 

No water meant no coffee, so booked at table through [AndCo](https://www.andco.life/) and spent the morning working from the Dixon hotel. A change of scene is always good, but this time it threw [my time blocks](/writing/time-blocking/) out of sync – not exactly the best start.

Started looking into hosting sites via [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS). The whole open-source, decentralised peer-to-peer thing is a great fit for [building resilient websites](https://practicalhugo.com/). Continuous deployment is made very easy with [Fleek](https://fleek.co/), the open-web’s answer to Netlify. Think I’ll have to add a new lesson to the *deploying your site to the web* module.

This afternoon I found a spare few minutes, so bought back my [/things](/things) page. It’s not much, but it will do for now. Somewhere to keep track of personal projects, tools I’ve built, things like that.

Work related projects are now [case studies](/topics/case-study/). Still lots to add.
