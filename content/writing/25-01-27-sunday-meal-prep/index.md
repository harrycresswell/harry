Trying to get into the whole food prep thing. The goal is to always have healthy options to pull out of the fridge throughout the week. I tend make unhealthy decisions when I’m short on time and there’s nothing convenient to eat, so preparing a few versatile things helps to solve this problem.

For the last couple of weeks we’ve made a bunch of spreads and dips on a Sunday afternoon. Usually a humous, a romesco and some sort of pesto that will go well with anything, from veggie sticks to pasta. We also roast some cashews and almonds and make cacao-based energy balls to replace unhealthy sweet snacks, which I often crave towards the end of the day.

Recently I learnt how important it is to [start the day with a savoury meal](https://youtu.be/3esF-pNAM9c?si=cOlIV89BCnkhbja0&t=1771) (spoiler: it helps to reduce your blood glucose spikes which can lead to all sorts of disease). So yesterday we prepared all the ingredients for breakfast burritos with a bit of a healthy twist – scrambled tofu, homemade baked beans, guacamole, kimchi and spinach and chickpea flour pancakes.

I have to say, it felt kinda weird eating a burrito for breakfast on a Monday, And part of me missed the usual porridge topped with seeds, fruit and nuts. But it was tasty nonetheless and I’m sure I can get into it.

Hopefully we can keep this up, but let’s see how it goes. At some point I’d like to get another glucose monitor to see if this new approach to breakfast actually makes a difference.
