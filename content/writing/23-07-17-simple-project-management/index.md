Since falling out with Notion, I’ve been on the hunt for a simple project management tool for managing projects, both client and personal.

Working independently, I rarely find the need for collaboration features that a team may find useful. What I really need is something that doesn’t get in the way of actually doing the work. Ideally, something that meets following criteria:

- Simple, fast and reliable
- Easy to host wherever I want
- Works/doesn’t lag without an internet connection
- Will scale over the long term without any limits
- Works using text files (ideally Markdown) and folders
- Won’t lock me in to using the application
- Open-source (preferably)
- Private and secure

As a massive fan of static site generators, Hugo in particular, the requirements I’ve listed above make total sense to me. And, thankfully, it seems there’s a new wave of software applications being built with these things in mind.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is one of these apps. And it ticks all the boxes.

Under the hood, Obsidian is just a bunch of plain-text content files and folders, much like any other file or folder on your system. This means it’s simple, fast and reliable. It works just fine without an internet connection and it will scale without any issues, over the long term.

Content in Obsidian is stored in what’s known as a Vault. A vault is private and secure by default and can be hosted locally, or remotely in the cloud, so you’re always in full control of your content. 

Content is written in Markdown, which is a widely supported content format, meaning you’re not tied in to using the application. If you choose to move away from Obsidian in the future, it’s very easy to get hold of your content and take it elsewhere.

Using Obsidian is a lot like working with a static site generator, in a way. You have content files, you have content templates, you can even link between notes, like you would pages on a website.

Although it’s marketed as a note-taking app for personal knowledge management, I’ve started using Obsidian for project management, with a very simple workflow.

1. Add a new note to a *projects* folder for every new project.
2. Create a todo list of tasks to complete for the project inside each note.
3. When the tasks are complete, move the project note to the archive folder.

It couldn’t be simpler.

This is typically all I need to manage a project, these days. Plain text, a content template and a simple todo list. 

At some point, I might find a client needs access to a kanban type project board, for whatever reason. In this situation, then something simple like Trello is probably now what I’d turn to. But I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it. 

For now, Obsidian is exactly what I’m looking for.
