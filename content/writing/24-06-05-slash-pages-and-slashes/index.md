[“Slash pages”](https://rknight.me/blog/slash-pages/) is a great phrase for root-level pages usually found on personal websites. I’m into it.

Well done to [Caleb Hearth](https://calebhearth.com/) and [Shellsharks](https://shellsharks.com/) for coining the phrase. Also Brandon for building [slashpages.net](https://slashpages.net/), which lists the most common slash pages and provides a clear definition:

> Slash pages are common pages you can add to your website, usually with a standard, root-level slug like /now, /about, or /uses. They tend to describe the individual behind the site and are distinguishing characteristics of the IndieWeb.

Annie’s idea of creating [a slashes page for your slash pages](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/05/a-slashes-page-for-my-slash-pages) is also really clever. 

It’s not always clear which slash pages exist when you visit a website. Unless they’re all listed in a navigation somewhere – which invariably they aren’t. So listing them on their own dedicated page is extremely helpful.

Now we can add our [/slashes](/slashes) page somewhere in our site navigation instead. 

I like this idea a lot. It give visitors a quick way to access all the slash pages on your site (some of which may otherwise be missed). It also solves the problem of cluttering your navigation with too many links. Great stuff. 

Thanks to [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/slashes), for putting me onto this, and [Bryce](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2024/06/slash-pages-existing-new/) for encouraging me to revisit my existing slash pages and prune back the dead growth.
