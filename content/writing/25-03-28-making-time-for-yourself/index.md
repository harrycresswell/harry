Friends and family often ask if I still do my weekly sessions, even though I‘m feeling  good these days and thankfully have for a while. 

I still go, I tell them, but now every other week, instead of every week. Often that comes as a surprise and is usual met with a follow up question. Something along the lines of; “But you’re feeling fine now right, how comes you still go?”

Until now, I’ve struggled to give a clear answer to explain the reasons why I continue going. However, in todays session I got some clarity.

Every week we block out time in our calendars dedicated to meeting the needs of others. Clients, bosses, colleagues, family, and so on. But, other than perhaps some physical exercise, we often fail to do the same for ourselves. 

Talking therapy, counselling, or whatever you wish to call it, is blocking 50 minutes of time each week (or every other week in my case) for yourself. It’s a massive help during times of crisis, but it’s also invaluable when you’re feeling great, too. 

When I’m feeling good, I typically use therapy as a general check-in. A chance to reflect on what I’ve been up to and whether I’m heading in the right direction. It’s time I dedicate to helping myself navigate the world. Time to get some clarity on whatever occupies my mind and figure out an appropriate step forward. 

However good I feel, I always leave my sessions with a fresh perspective on things and clear idea of where to head next. I’d recommend it to anyone, whether in crisis or not. 

Here in the UK, at least, it seems many people still view therapy as something only for those who are in a seriously bad way. People on a knifes edge. Crazies, struggling to keep their shit together. From what I’ve seen, this stigma continues to persist, particularly in men. It’s a shame, as they have no idea what they’re missing out on.
