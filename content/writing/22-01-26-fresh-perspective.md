Lately I’ve been spending my early mornings in Notion, writing this Hugo course. But I’ve also been in spending a good bit of time in Figma, working on [the course website](https://practicalhugo.com/). 

I was really struggling to nail down the lesson order whilst looking at it in Notion, perhaps it’s somewhat counterintuitive to constantly shift pages around.

The funny thing is, as soon as I moved the curriculum into Figma to work on the design, it was much easier to make sense of. It sort of just fell into place. 

I guess a change of context gives you a fresh perspective on things.
