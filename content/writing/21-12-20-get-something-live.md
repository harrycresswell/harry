Trying not to loose focus in the run up to Christmas, so today I set myself a simple goal – get something live on [practicalhugo.com](http://www.practicalhugo.com/) by the end of the day.

It’s not much, but it’s something and I’m telling myself that’s all that matters – move fast with easy wins and make progress through iteration.

I hoped to add a sign up form, but I was working on it between meetings. Then I went down a rabbit whole thinking about how to make the _leanest Hugo site possible_, as you so often do.

Some very quick thoughts on this, before I switch off for th evening.

What’s the least amount of code (Hugo templating, HTML, CSS, etc) it takes to build a website that works well and looks great? A **minimum viable website**, if you like. 

Something for an intro lesson perhaps.

I’ll think more about this tomorrow, when I get on with that sign up form.
