In compliance with UK data and privacy laws (“GDPR”) and in an effort to be more transparent, I have assembled the following information about the data I collect on this website, how I handle it and what I do to help maintain your privacy.

## What data I collect

From this website, I collect the name and email address of those who sign up for [my newsletter](/newsletter/) using the form at the bottom of each page. I also collect the name, email address and message of anyone who contacts me via my [contact](/contact/) page.
 
**This websites does not store cookies** on your machine, so I cannot identify or track your behaviour when you browse the content on this site. You can verify this using a tool like [Cookiemetrix](https://www.cookiemetrix.com/) or [Cookieserve](https://www.cookieserve.com/).

Similarly, **this website does not use analytics** of any kind to track visitors, however I do use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/) for measuring traffic from Google Search to my site.

## What I do with data

The data I collect via my newsletter sign up form is stored in my [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) account and used for the sole purpose of sending newsletters.  I only email people who have genuinely signed up to receive my newsletters. I have no intention of selling your information to any third party data brokers.

The data I collect from my contact page is stored by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), who send me a notification via email when a submision has been received. I use this data to correspond with the contact via email. If the contact becomes a client, then I may use this data to process invoices using [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com/), my accounting software.

## How I keep your data safe

I use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to randomly generate and store a 28-character password for my Brevo, Netlify and FreeAgent accounts. I also use [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) (2FA) in order to keep these accounts as safe as possible from hacks. 

With Brevo, I use [double opt-in](https://www.brevo.com/blog/double-opt-in/) during the sign up process to prevent spam accounts and include an unsubscribe link on every email I send out.

_⚠️ While I take the security of your personal data extremely seriously, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security, particularly from third party data breaches._

## If you have any concerns

Please [contact me](https://harrycresswell.com/contact), as soon as possible, if you have any concerns about how your data is being handled or would like me to destroy it.
