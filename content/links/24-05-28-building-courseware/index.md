> CSS Nouveau isn’t just a “course”. It’s a *series*. And a *series* will have multiple *seasons*. (This first season is actually titled “Vanilla Has Never Tasted So Hot”.) And each *season* will have multiple *episodes*. And an *episode* is structured much like how I’d write an in-depth blog post.
