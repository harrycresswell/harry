> “Privacy regulations are a step in the right direction, but exercising your rights under these legislations is still hard enough for most people not to bother with it. The situation is made worse because many organizations make it hard to file data requests (for example by not publishing any corporate email addresses on their website). Our aim is to make the rights granted by these legislations accessible to everyone.”
