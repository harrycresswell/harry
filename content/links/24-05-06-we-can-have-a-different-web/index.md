> “Nothing about the web has changed that prevents us from going back. If anything, it's become a lot easier. *We can return.* Better, yet: we can restore the things we loved about the old web while incorporating the wonderful things that have emerged since, developing even better things as we go forward, and leaving behind some things from the early web days we all too often forget when we put on our rose-colored glasses.

A wonderful reminder from Molly White that beyond the reinforced walls of big tech, “the old web” still exists. 

It’s never been easier to set up a personal site, start blogging, use RSS, create blogrolls, and webrings, and do all those fun things that made the web what it was in the *good old days*.
