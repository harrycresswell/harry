> Today, we are creating innumerable digital artifacts, but most of these artifacts are out of our control. They are stored on servers, in databases, gated behind an internet connection, and login to a cloud service. Even the files on your hard drive use proprietary formats that make them incompatible with older systems and other tools.

> *File over app* is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.
>
> You should want the files you create to be durable, not only for posterity, but also for your future self. You never know when you might want to go back to something you created years or decades ago. Don’t lock your data into a format you can’t retrieve.

I’ve been a fan of Steph’s philosophy since I starting using Obsidian.

Creating content using plain-text files makes a lot of sense. Plain-text is simple and resilient. When Obsidian disappears the work will remain.
 
The [Rule of least power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power) and the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) both come to mind.
