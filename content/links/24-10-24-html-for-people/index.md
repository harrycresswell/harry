> HTML isn’t only for people working in the tech field. It’s for anybody, the way documents are for anybody. HTML is just another type of document. A very special one—the one the web is built on.

I love how accessible Blake Watson has made *HTML for people*, a fantastic course on building websites using good old HTML. With all the fancy web development tooling out there these days, it’s easy to turn your nose up at HTML. But HTML is a great choice for building robust websites, and Blake makes it so easy to learn that anyone can do it.

Thanks to Blake’s *Adding a resume* lesson, I felt inspired to ditch my old PDF CV for [a new CV page](/cv) version. Go checkout the course if you haven’t already.
