> I rarely, if ever, have a social post from a few months ago that continuously garners attention (likes, responses, etc.) Whereas I frequently have blog posts from years ago that garner bursts of traffic because someone, somewhere (re)discovered it, shared it, linked to it, and drove attention to it.

 Jim’s spot on with this one.

I often receive emails about blog posts I wrote years back. It pretty much always happens because someone opened a search engine, searched for answers to their problem and one of my old blog posts happened to provide the answers they were looking for. They keep resurfacing and it’s quite incredible. 

Even so, trying to convince friends to consider blogging over social media usually falls on deaf ears. I guess it’s not easy to appreciate the long term benefits, as, unlike a bunch of likes, they’re not immediately obvious or gratifying.

Perhaps I’ll try Jim’s *compound interest* metaphor next time.

> The power of a good blog post is like the power of compound interest: the impact seems minor and insignificant to start, but as time passes the effects compound and become quite substantial.
