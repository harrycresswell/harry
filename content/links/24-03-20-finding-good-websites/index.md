> I think it's really important that every blog have a Links page or a Blog Roll. In today's internet, finding good websites is difficult, and similar to the early days of the net when everything wasn't listed in a search engine, the best way to find content is by word of mouth.

In [Links page update](https://brandonwrites.xyz/links-page-update/) Brandon talks about the importance of spreading good links by word of mouth (via your personal website). 

Only fitting that this should be the first post on my new /links page.
