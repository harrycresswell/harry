Write it and publish it, and then *iterate on that*. Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me communicate better? Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give my audience more understanding? If the answer is "no," don't add it.

Blogging really helps you shift to this way of thinking. 

But it can be challenging with clients. There’s always that one who wants to see the design first, so they can shoehorn their words in afterwards.

Invariably, the solution to this problem can be found in not skimping on the discovery phase. It’s such an important step.

I like to send clients a bunch of questions. Get them to write about their business, so you’ve got some words to work with.
