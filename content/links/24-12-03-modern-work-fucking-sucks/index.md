> “By the time Friday rolls around, you’ve done nothing tangible, produced nothing meaningful, and yet you’re exhausted — an entire week spent shuffling bits of information between fifteen different systems, each charging a tidy $15 per month, per user, for the privilege of making you _feel_ productive.”

I share Joan’s sentiment: Most productivity tools are a distraction and a complete waste of time, let alone money. 

I realised this [a while back](/writing/notion-no-more/), so I’m cautious about adopting new tools now, particularly the ones that claim they do _the lot_. Invariably these are empty promises. The annoying part is that you usually don’t realise until you’ve wasted a bunch of time using them.

What works for me is to keep it boring and simple.

All communication happens via good old email (Tuta Mail). Project and task management happens locally, in plain text files (Obsidian). I keep track of my commitments using a regular calendar (Tuta Calendar). For meetings, I use a tool that’s reliable and doesn’t require an account to use (Jitsi Meet or Google Meets, when a client organises it). Though I don’t love supporting Google – and [I’ve done a fair amount to De-Google](/writing/de-googling/) – I still find myself using Google Docs with clients, because it’s intuitive, makes collaboration easy, and I’m yet to meet a client who has struggled to work with it.

I don’t use any fancy tools like Asana, Monday, Jira, Zoom, Slack or Trello. And I refuse to use Slack for work related communication.

But I’m fortunate as an independent freelancer. I don’t work in huge teams, so I can choose which tools to work with and which to avoid. I feel for those who have no other option but to be part of the circus. Who have to deal with the overwhelm and give up their focus, all because the organisation they’re a part of thinks this is work.
