Now I have [a name for my Hugo course](https://harrycresswell.com/updates/practical-hugo/) it’s tempting to go all guns blazing with a whole new identity and website. 

Somehow I managed to convince myself that all I really need right now is a basic landing page and sign up form. But it’s hard not to do something to bring all this to life, so I ended up designing a simple color palette and logo mark.

If you’re familiar with Hugo, then you might well recognise the mark as an abstraction of [the Hugo logo](https://gohugo.io/img/hugo.png). 

Remove the color and the type, round the corners and tweaked the shape (to satisfy my obsession with the 8pt grid). Now I have something different, yet familiar – try and do me for plagiarism.

Alongside this work I’ve been putting a curriculum outline together. I know content is where I should focus my energy. But planning content is a lot more difficult than I was expecting. I’m used turning notes into articles, so this is a real mindset shift.

Maybe I’m overthinking it, but that’s only because I want this course to be more than the typical  tutorial. At least this *lite* branding exercise has helped make it feel like more of a thing.

At some point I should share [this course on Twitter](https://twitter.com/practicalhugo) and I will in time. But it’s almost the holidays and I doubt many of you are listening. One thing at a time, I’m in no rush and I’m having fun with it.

But if you are listening then maybe you can help me? 

Is there’s anything specific you’re struggling with, or would like to learn about Hugo? [Let’s have a chat](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com), I’d love to hear about it.
