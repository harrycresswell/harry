Now I have [a name for my Hugo course](https://harrycresswell.com/updates/practical-hugo/) it’s tempting to go all guns blazing with a whole new identity and website. 

Somehow I managed to convince myself that all I really need right now is a basic landing page and sign up form. But it’s hard not to do something to bring all this to life, so I ended up designing a simple color palette and logo mark.

If you’re familiar with Hugo, then you might well recognise the mark as an abstraction of [the Hugo logo](https://gohugo.io/img/hugo.png). 

Remove the color and the type, round the corners and tweaked the shape (to satisfy my obsession with the 8pt grid). Now I have something different, yet familiar – try and do me for plagiarism.

I’ve been putting a curriculum outline together alongside this, as I know content is where I should focus my energy. But planning content is a lot more difficult than I was expecting. I’m used turning notes into articles, so this is a real mindset shift.

Maybe I’m overthinking it, but that’s only because I want this course to be more than the typical  tutorial. At least this *lite* branding exercise has helped make it feel like more of a thing.

At some point I should share [this course on Twitter](https://twitter.com/practicalhugo) and I will in time. But it’s almost the holidays and I doubt many of you are listening. One thing at a time, I’m in no rush and I’m having fun with it.
