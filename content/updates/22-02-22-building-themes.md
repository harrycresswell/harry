This week I’ve been writing about themes for a new module in [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/). It‘s made me think about my own. As a result I’ve spent time tidying up my personal site, pulling out unused styles, making small adjustments to the design and reducing complexity where I can.

I’ve built a bunch of Hugo themes over the years, usually for clients or personal projects. But, I’ve never actually open-sourced one for others to use. I’m not sure why that is. It seems bizarre that I haven’t, now I come to think about it. This year I want to change that by sharing a couple with the community. It’s fun building themes and a good way to give back.

I’m often asked about the design of [my personal site](https://github.com/harrycresswell/harry), I’ve even given the theme away to those that have asked if they can use it. So it seems like the obvious place to start. 

I’ve also been working on my [moodboard](https://mood.harrycresswell.com/) theme. It’s not your typical Hugo theme given the content is mainly visual–single pages feel more like an old lightbox gallery, but there’s no JavaScript involved. On that note, I removed [lazysizes.js](https://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/index.html) and opted for native lazy loading with [low quality image placeholders](https://cloudinary.com/blog/low_quality_image_placeholders_lqip_explained) instead. Now we’re 100% JavaScript free and there’s an air of [wabi-sabi](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20181021-japans-unusual-way-to-view-the-world) about it. No animation or what have you. It feels a bit rough around the edges, which I’ve come to like.
