It’s been a while since I wrote one of these updates. I’ve been busy with client work, so I haven’t found the time.   

I’ve also been travelling. We’re back in Hamburg for the week, visiting family and catching up with old friends. It’s hard to do it all.

In these situations I try to remind myself to lower my expectations. Productivity ebbs and flows, and that’s ok. These  [projects](/things/) are long term games and there’s no rush to complete them.

Just as important is slowing down and taking time off. Appreciating where you’re at and creating space makes work more sustainable.
