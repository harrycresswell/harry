When you smash things out quickly – as I’m doing with these updates – it’s easy to forget what you’ve written, even from just a few weeks back. 

It happened yesterday, when I wrote about [structing this course around a bunch of practical projects](/updates/resilient-research/). I had that funny feeling of Déjà Vu. Typically it happened right after I hit publish. 

*Have I written this before?* 

I soon realised [I shared these exact same ideas in a previous update](/updates/course-utility/).

But that’s ok. It’s all part of the process. Things take time, sometimes a few times to make sense of. What I like about these updates is they’re unpolished and real – you’re getting it as I’m getting it, exactly how it is.

Anyway. Today I spent the day working on [my year end review](/writing/2021-review/). I didn’t do much else. It felt good to find some flow and spend the whole day writing – getting thoughts out of your head and into some sort of order. It’s been a while since I’ve had the luxury of writing all day. 

One more day of that, please. It’s all I ask.
