I’m writing on my phone more and more these days.  I seem to find it much easier to keep my writing concise and to the point when working on a tiny screen.

Perhaps it’s because there’s not so much empty page staring back at you.  It’s less overwhelming when you can fill the page with a few short paragraphs. 

Typing with two thumbs is also a real effort, so there’s an incentive to pick your words wisely and say what you have to say in as few words as possible. 

I love these kind of constraints. They somehow make you more creative. They force you to slow down and think, before you take action.
