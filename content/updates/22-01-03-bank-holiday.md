It’s a bank holiday here today in the UK, so it was nice and quiet – a good chance to focus on developing this course outline. If all goes well I’ll get an early version up on [practicalhugo.com](https://practicalhugo.com/) by the end of the week, then look to get some feedback.

I was thinking about whether I should include Git in the course. I don’t want to overcomplicate things, so I might leave it until I cover deploying a site to the web in a later module. 

Either way, I think it’s unavoidable. Continuous deployment is kinda fundamental to the Jamstack web development workflow, so I think I’ve answered my own question there – it would be a mistake to leave it out.

Something else I just realised is I’m burying all [my Hugo articles](/topics/hugo/) under all these updates, so I’ll try and figure out a better way to organise these soon.
