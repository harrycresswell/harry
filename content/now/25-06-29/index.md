Today I ran the [Hella Halbmarthon](https://www.hamburg-halbmarathon.de/) in Hamburg ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

It was a hot one, we totally messed up our pacing, but it was great fun nonetheless. I managed to come in bang on the 2hr mark after chasing down the 2hr pacer with a 23min final 5km. Pretty happy with that.
