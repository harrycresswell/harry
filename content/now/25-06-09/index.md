I’m in London right now, where it looks like we’re in for a warm week. The garden is in full swing and we’ve got more raspberries than we know what to do with. 

## What I’m working on

I’m juggling a few different client projects at the moment, alongside my own. So far I’m feeling fairly calm about it. Hopefully that doesn’t change anytime soon.

I’m building up for the [Hamburg Halbmarathon](https://www.hamburg-halbmarathon.com/) later this month. Yesterday I ran the ~15km route up to Greenwich, then along the Thames Path to London Brige. It’s a great route, especially in the sun on a Sunday morning when it’s nice and quiet.

## Things I’m learning

I just finished Compound Content from [Visualise Value](https://visualizevalue.com/), which I highly recommend if you’re interested in learning how to improve your content for search engines.

Now I’m about to make a start on Jack McDade’s [Radical Design](https://radicaldesigncourse.com/) course. It’s been on my radar for a while and, as Jack’s design style is quite a bit different from my own, I’m intrigued to see what new techniques I can learn.

My Duolingo streak is still going strong, 512 days of German and counting.


## Things I’m enjoying

I’m slightly surpised how much we’ve gotten into the [The Chosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chosen_(TV_series)). Neither of us are particularly religious, but it’s been facinating to learn more about the life of Jesus. Watching the show has also sparked many interesting conversations over dinner.

Somewhat related, I picked up a copy of [UFO of God](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63884226-ufo-of-god), which tells the story of Chris Bledsoe’s encounters with the phenomena; how it’s impacted his life and how many believe his experiences have a religious connection. It’s a facinating read regardless of what you choose to believe.
