![Sitting by the Alster, enjoying the sun and a pizza from Spezzagrano](https://res.cloudinary.com/harrycresswell/image/upload/v1748424846/hc/harry-at-alster_dd6mib_f4tsdr.jpg)

I’m currently in Hamburg visiting old friends and meeting new arrivals. We grabbed pizza last night from [our favourite spot](https://spezzagrano.de/en/) and sat by the Alster with a Gösser NaturRadler. It’s good to be back, especially with this great weather we’ve been having lately.

Tomorrow we head to Schleswig-Holstein to see R’s family and celebrate her aunt and uncles 50th wedding anniversary. Should be a good chance to practice my German!
