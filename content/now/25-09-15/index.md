Yesterday I ran run the [Kallithea Half Marathon](http://www.kallitheahalf.gr/index.php/en/) in Athens. 

Except for a small section around the water by the [Stavros Niarchos Cultural Center](https://www.snfcc.org/en/), it was three laps of a fairly unexciting route in brutal 30°c heat. Not easy.

To be honest, it was touch and go as to whether I would even run it, as I‘ve only just recovered from a nasty bout of flu. That, combined with the total lack of support lining the route (apart from R, of course 👏), didn’t make it any easier. 10k in and I was questioning my decision to run. I mostly just didn’t have the legs for it, due to a complete lack of long distance training over the past few months.

Anyway, given all of the above, I was pleased to come in at 1hr52mins. That’s 8mins faster than Hamburg in June, so I don’t have much to complain about.

Now we’re off to do some island hoping for the next couple of weeks. I’m looking forward to sitting on a beach, reading a book and recovering these sore legs.
