I’m currently in a very wet Berlin with a bunch of friends. We’re here celebrating the release of [Benyayer – Morpho](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQMF37giM_2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), which I created the artwork for (in collabration with Matt, who also made the music).

Yesterday we started with brunch at [Frühstück 3000](https://fruehstueck3000.com/en/), then snuck in a quick trip to [Neues Museum](https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/neues-museum/exhibitions/detail/ancient-egypt/), where we spent a couple of hours wandering around the Ancient Egypt exhibition. Well worth te trip if you’re ever in Berlin.

After a quick bite at [Canal bakery](https://canal.berlin/), we headed to Element Bar in Neukölln, where [Sohana FC](https://www.instagram.com/sohanafc/) hosted their second Indian supper club – incredible experience!

Matt played some records at [Paloma Bar](https://www.instagram.com/paloma_berlin/), including a few from the new album, to see out the evening. It was a fun night with a great bunch of people, some of whom I hadn’t seen in a very long time.

Tonight we all ate ramen together at [Buya Ramen Factory](https://buyarestaurants.com/buya-ramen-kreuzberg.html), which was exactly what we all needed after a big night out. All in all, a very good weekend.

Until the next time Berlin.
