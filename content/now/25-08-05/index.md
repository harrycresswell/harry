I’m in London at the minute. These are the things I’m focusing on right now.

## What I’m working on

I’m in the process of moving my newsletter away from Mailchimp. Although the UX is terrible and forms are impossible to find, I have no major qualms with Mailchimp. I’m leaving because I’m looking for a [European alternative](https://european-alternatives.eu/) that would be suitable to use with my european clients. Something agency friendly with a partnership program, that we can use over at [ERYN](https://studioeryn.com/). [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) seems like a good fit for us.

I’m spending a good bit of my days working on [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/). This has become a far bigger project than I initially anticipated, but I think it will turn into the one I’m most proud of. I’m hoping to release the first part very soon. 

I’m about to make a start on the [Buxton Three Two](https://buxtonthreetwo.com/) redesign. Generally I don’t do much GSAP on client projects, so this is a rare opportunity to play with some JavaScript animation. 

I’ve been off social media for years now, but I’ve been lazy about deleting my accounts. Having recently stumbled upon [cyd](https://cyd.social/), I figured I’d make a start by winding down my ~~Twitter~~ X accounts.

## Things I’m learning

I just picked up a copy of [The Ethical Design Handbook](https://ethicaldesignhandbook.com/) by Trine Falbe, Martin Michael Frederiksen and Kim Andersen.

I’m slowing working through Jack’s [Radical Design Course](https://radicaldesigncourse.com/). It’s been fun to see Jack’s process which is quite a bit different from my own.

Although I’ve been struggling to stick with it lately, my German streak on Duolingo is at 568 days. I guess it’s more difficult when it’s nice outside.

Figuring out mailing lists and all that fun stuff with Brevo.
