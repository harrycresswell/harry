I’m in London right now. 10°c, grey skies. Good conditions for getting on with things.

## What I’m working on

I’m currently exploring the idea of moving [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) away from Cloudflare Pages and instead self-hosting, using either [Coolify](https://www.coolify.io/) or [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/). It feels like a better fit considering the subject matter. 

I’m about to start migrating Solorsimple to Cloudcannon’s [Unified Configuration](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/), mainly to speed up the CMS and get the site inline with the Cloudcannon docs.

I’ve been looking into password protecting content on Hugo sites. A client needs a simple way to paywall her video courses until she’s ready to go [full-blown membership site](https://www.outseta.com/). It seems simple enough using a tool like [Pagecrypt](https://github.com/Greenheart/pagecrypt).

I finally made a start on [Practical Accessibility](https://practical-accessibility.today/). I’m only a few chapters, in but I’m already seriously impressed at what Sara has put together here.

## Away from my desk

I’ve been looking into setting up a [Lifetime ISA](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/lifetime-isas/) before I reach the cut off point (you have to be 39 or younger!). The 25% government bonus of up to £1000/tax year is pretty appealing. Worth noting you can only put 4k/year in and that comes out of the 20k ISA allowance.

We’ve been tiling the splashbacks in our kitchen with ceramic tiles from [Quorn Stone](https://www.mystonefloor.com/). It’s been a surprisingly cathartic process, for the most part. That is, until a tile requires cutting into an irregular shape. Angle grinder, wet or dry tile cutter, good old hacksaw...the jury’s still out on the best cutting tool.

I’m gearing up for another trip to the Alps next month. This time we’re heading to the Stubai Valley in Tyrol, Austria.

## Things I’m enjoying

- [Web Accessibility Cookbook](https://accessibility-cookbook.com/) by Manuel Matuzović.
- [Taylor Penton’s type design](https://taylorpenton.com/) which is giving me all sorts of ideas for a new typeface of my own.
- [Enshitification](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/enshittification-why-everything-suddenly-got-worse-and-what-to-do-about-it-cory-doctorow/7893787) by Cory Doctorow.
