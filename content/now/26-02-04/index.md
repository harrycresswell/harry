I made it down to [Here at Outernet](https://hereldn.com/) last night for the [Apparat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparat_(musician)) show, who was playing live with the full band. So so good. 

Support was from [K Á R Y Y N](https://www.karyynofficial.com/) who I wasn’t familiar with but found myself enjoying.

The sound at the venue is incredible. Hitting all the right levels, but where you can still hear yourself speak. Well worth a visit if you’re ever in London.
