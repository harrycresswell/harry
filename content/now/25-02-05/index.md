I’m currently in London, counting down the days until a big ski trip with a whole bunch of friends next month. It’s been a slow couple of weeks. Rebekka sprained her ankle  and is hobbling around with a crutch. We’re praying she’ll be healed enough to fit into her ski boots and make it down the mountain.

## Work is the right amount of busy

I’m juggling a couple of different client projects right now. An identity and website redesign for a millwork company, who make bespoke kitchens in Virginia. Along with a Hugo project for another client, that involves generating location-based landing pages from Google Sheets data. I’m also drafting a post that explains how this stuff works.

I just launched a new site for Rebekka’s agency [Studio Mailo](https://studiomailo.com/) and I’m still plugging away with my own projects: [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) and [cu css](https://cu.harrycresswell.com/).

## Making time for learning

I’m back using [time blocks](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/time-blocking/) (though they’ve changed a bit since that post) and finally finding time for structured learning - three two hour sessions per week. 

I’m currently about 50% of the way through Andy Bell’s [Complete CSS](https://piccalil.li/complete-css/). I’m all-in with Andy’s CUBE CSS and have been for a while now, but I’m still learning a bunch. It’s one hell of a course, I can highly recommend it.

[Matt](https://bnyr.net/about) has been teaching me Ableton. I’ve wanted to get back into music production for a while so I’m pleased we’re making it happen.

My Duolingo streak is still going strong, 388 days of German and counting.

## Things I’m enjoying

Having just finished the 2nd season of [SAS Rogue Heroes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10405370/) on BBC iPlayer, I picked up  the book version when I was passing Blackheath bookshop. It’s a real page turner, as I’ve come to expect from books by Ben Macintyre.

I’ve been listening music whilst designing, again. Feels like it’s been a while. I listen to way to many podcasts, so it’s been fun to switch it up and I seemed to be getting some good work done.
