I’m in a Bavaria, ice skating on [Höglwörther See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6glw%C3%B6rther_See), which is looking like a real winter wonderland right now. Haven’t done it in years, but getting the hang of it again surprisingly quickly.

There’s something quite special about having to clear the snow using your own shovel to reveal the frozen lake beneath.

Definitely one of my highlights of the year. Let’s hope the ice holds.
