I’m in London right now where it’s looking and feeling very much like Autumn.

## What I’m working on

Much of my client work right now is focused on UX/UI’ing the [AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/) website into the present. Behind the scenes  there’s been a complete rebuild of the tech team and a migration from Fuel to Symfony. It’s ongoing but we’re making headway.

When not tackling client projects, the majority of my work hours are focused on [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/). I haven’t set a launch date yet but we’re very close. I’m just tying up a few loose ends before publishing the first season.

Once that’s wrapped up I plan to switch my focus back to launching the phase two of the [ERYN](https://studioeryn.com/) website.

## Away from my desk

R and I just celebrated her 31st birthday with brunch at a Palestinian restaurant in Notting Hill called [Akub](https://www.akub-restaurant.com/). It was well worth the trek across London for. 

I started feeling stiffness in my achilles around 8k into the [Kallithea Half](/now/25-09-15/). I should have done more about it directly after the race, but we were on holiday and I got lazy. Needless to say, I paid the price for it. So the past few weeks I’ve been working through a really sore bout of tendonitis. Tone and Tighten has [a brilliant YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjwAxxQYqwM) that’s been super helpful for getting back on track. I managed to easy the pain within 3 or 4 days and I went for my first run back without any issues this morning.

## Things I’m considering

I’ve been noodling on doing something creative again. I feel the urge to start a sketchbook or work on a new typeface, perhaps. Neither of which I’ve done in years.

We have a bunch of marker pens in the office which we never use, so I was thinking about working my way through them. We stumbled upon some great street art in Athens which gave me some ideas. Let’s see if this pans out.

[Type design](https://typeservices.co/) is something I’ve explored on and off over the years. And, whenever I see cool type foundry like [Beasts of England](https://beastsofengland.co/), which I found via [Luis Mendo’s awesome site](https://www.mundomendo.com/) courtesy of [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/25/10/0047723-luis-mendo-is-self-publis), I think to myself I should really make more of my own type design project.

## Things I’m enjoying

I just started watching [Babylon Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_Berlin), mainly to practice my German. Set during a fascinating period between the first and second world war, I won’t spoil it for those that haven’t see it, but what I will say is that it’s much better than I was expecting. 

I’ve been working through my Obsidian vault, replacing all my Dataview tables with [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases). It’s an exciting tool and the filtering is awesome. Unlike Notion, all bases start with the entire contents of you vault. Then it’s a case of filtering what you need based on the properties (front matter) in your notes. No more content siloed in a database. It’s super powerful and a well thoughtout addition to Obsidian.
