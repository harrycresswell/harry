I’ve been enjoying some time off in Greece the past couple of weeks. 

We explored lots of interesting new places and a few familiar ones. We met great people, had interesting convesations and ate great food. Days with minimal screen time and spent mainly outside. Walking, cycling, swimming and reading on the beach. Exactly what you want from a well needed break. 

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Met up with friends in Athens and ran the [Kallithea Half Marthon](/now/25-09-15/).

Discovered some great spots in Neapoli, including [Kora Bakery](https://www.korabakery.com/en/), Ama Lachei and [Taníni Agápi Mou](https://www.instagram.com/tanini_agapi_mou/). All well worth a visit.

Spent time on two of the Saronic islands: Highlights include hiking around Agistri and staying at [Maison Madeleine](https://maisonmadeleineporos.com/en/guest-house-poros/) in Poros. 

Read [The Hunt for Zero Point](https://www.nickcook.works/the-hunt-for-zero-point/) by Nick Cook and [Rich Dad, Poor Dad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69571.Rich_Dad_Poor_Dad) by Robert T. Kiyosaki.

Watched Asteroid City, The Outrun and Alien Earth.

## Elsewhere on the web

[Does financial success come at a social price?](https://www.lifeafterthedailygrind.com/p/does-financial-success-come-at-a)

> “Chores, waiting in line and requests for help may feel like inefficiencies to be eliminated, yet they are also points of contact with other people. When we strip them away in pursuit of productivity, we do save time, but it comes at the expense of reduced serendipity and connection. And in the process, as Patricia Greenfield and others have observed, we become more atomised, more individualistic, and less human

> In chasing more, we risk neglecting what our ancestors had in abundance: bonds, shared purpose, and community. They were materially poor but socially rich. We are materially rich but, too often, socially poor.”

Everything Richard writes is well worth reading.

[The Coyier CSS Starter](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/the-coyier-css-starter/) from Chris Coyier.

Chris shares the principles and decisions behind his recent CSS starter/reset. A similar post I enjoyed reading was [David Bushell’s CSS reset](https://dbushell.com/2025/09/12/css-reset/).

[The Privacy Rabbit Hole](https://www.alexhyett.com/newsletter/the-privacy-rabbit-hole/) from Alex Hyett.

Alex shares his “threat model” (concerns surrounding privacy) and offers some simple solutions which aim to reduce these threats.

Two great pieces by Anton Sten:

[How to stand out when anyone can build anything](https://www.antonsten.com/articles/how-to-stand-out-when-anyone-can-build-anything/).

> “Start optimizing for user understanding, clear communication, business value, and thoughtful execution”.

Anton shares the skills that actually matter now that AI is doing most of the work.

[AI will happily design the wrong thing for you](https://www.antonsten.com/articles/ai-will-happily-design-the-wrong-thing-for-you/)

> “AI is leverage. It amplifies whatever you bring to it.
> 
> The future belongs to people who combine human insight with AI capability. Not people who think they can skip the human part.”

Anton addresses the problem with how most people use AI and how to avoid it.

## What I’m up to in October
