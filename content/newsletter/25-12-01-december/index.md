With the festive season right round the corner, I have to say, I’ve never felt more ready to wind things down, put my feet up and spend a good bit of time with the family.

This year has been a bit of a mixed bag for me personally. A difficult time for client work in some ways, yet a really positive one for personal projects. I plan on giving this careful consideration in the final few weeks of the year, so that I can hopefully begin 2026 with renewed energy and perhaps a slightly different plan.

Anyway, as per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

A [great weekend in Berlin](/now/25-11-16/) celebrating the release of Morpho with old friends and new.

The [Morpho launch party](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRpE8MTiBaW/?hl=en&img_index=7) at Avalon Cafe in Bermondsey.

Exploring Camden’s vegan food scene with [Rebal Tours](https://rebeltours.co.uk/).

Picked up a copy of [Web Accessibility Cookbook by Manuel Matuzović](https://accessibility-cookbook.com/) in the Black Friday sales and it’s very good.

Improving my skiing at Snozone park day.

Sunday lunch at [The Marksman](https://www.marksmanpublichouse.com/).

## Elsewhere on the web

[Why Do You Need Big Tech for Your SSG?](https://kevquirk.com/blog/why-do-you-need-big-tech-for-your-ssg/).

Kev Quirk on “why small, personal websites don’t need big-tech static hosting, and how a simple local build and rsync workflow gives you faster deploys, more control, and far fewer dependencies.”

[Local vs Cloud](https://kevquirk.com/blog/local-vs-cloud/).

Another one from Kev that’ll get you thinking. Do you really want to give away control by using someone else’s computer (the cloud) or does it make more sense to create your own local private cloud? As Kev puts it: “The real choice isn’t cloud or local, it’s whose cloud you want to rely on.”

[Some practical examples of view transitions to elevate your UI](https://piccalil.li/blog/some-practical-examples-of-view-transitions-to-elevate-your-ui/).

It’s never easy knowing how to apply powerful new web features to real world projects. View transitions is no exception, however a little guidance from Declan Chidlow definitely goes a long way.

[Getting Creative With Small Screens](https://css-tricks.com/getting-creative-with-small-screens/).

Andy Clarke gives us some good ideas for how to translate distinctive and memorable editorial-style layouts to smaller screens.

[An accessible pagination pattern (or two)](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/an-accessible-pagination-pattern-or-two).

Martin Underhill shares how he implemented accessible pagination on his personal site.

## What I’m up to in December

- Planning the release of Practical Hugo.
- More skiing at Snozone.
- Taking a trip to Warwickshire to see family.
- Winding down for the holidays.
- Celebrating Christmas with family.
- Writing my year in review.
