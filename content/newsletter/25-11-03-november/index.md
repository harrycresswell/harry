I like Autumn. With the changing weather I don’t feel quite so bad about spending time inside. And there’s plenty to do around the house right now. 

Spurred by a little post holiday motivation, we’ve just made a start on our kitchen renovation – the reason this newsletter’s out later than I hoped. So far I’ve learnt that using paint stripper to remove gloss paint is a terrible idea. It creates a nasty gunk that sticks to everything. Save yourself the trouble and use a heat gun instead. 

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Stamford Bridge going [absolutely bananas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGGa-scpPrk) as Chelsea scored a 95th minute winner to beat Liverpool. Incredible scenes.

Celebrating R’s 31st birthday at Palestinian restaurant [Akub](https://www.akub-restaurant.com/) in Notting Hill.

Completing [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) Season 1 content. Not long now.

Practicing my German by watching [Babylon Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_Berlin).

> “We're wired to seek out distraction, novel information, and entertainment, and avoid boredom at all costs. But boredom is where creativity and self-reflection do their best work. It's why "all the best ideas come when you're in the shower"—we don't usually take our phones with us into the shower (yet).”

> “It's vital that you understand that you've been presented with an extremely distorted view about what tech workers really think about AI. Very few agree with the hype bubble that the tycoons have been trying to puff up.”
