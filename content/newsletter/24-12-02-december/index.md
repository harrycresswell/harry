I’m a big fan of December. 

Typically work is a little less busy at this time of year, so it’s a great chance to slow down, find time to do things for myself, which I haven’t had a chance to do, spend time with family, and, of course, reflect on the year. If all goes well, at some point that last part should find its way into the usual [annual review](/topics/year-in-review/). 

Reflection isn’t always easy when you’ve got a terrible memory and forget what you’ve been up to, so writing these newsletters is a massive help for that. A quick skim through past issues, and I realise I packed a good bit in to another good year. It makes me think we should probably all be writing more, even if it’s just journaling and you never hit publish.

Anyway, as per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Built and launched a new website for [Solarsimple](https://solarsimplellc.com/), which was designed by the team at [Sherwood Fellows](https://sherwoodfellows.com/).

Saw the [Young Musicians Symphony Orchestra](https://www.ymso.org.uk/) at Cadogan Hall.

Watched [The Billion Dollar Code](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15392100/).

Finally won a pub quiz after several failed attempts.

Started Ableton Live lessons with [Matt](https://bnyr.net/about).

## Elsewhere on the web

[Making content-aware components using CSS :has(), grid, and quantity queries](https://piccalil.li/blog/making-content-aware-components-using-css-has-grid-and-quantity-queries/) from Eric Bailey is an excellent example of the sorts of resilient components that can be built now, using modern CSS techniques.

I just got my copy of [Complete CSS](https://piccalil.li/complete-css), the new course from Andy Bell’s Set Studio. I’ve learnt a ton from Andy over the years, so I’m excited to get started with this one. 

In [The rise of static-first websites: why major brands are making the switch](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/the-rise-of-static-first-websites-why-major-brands-are-making-the-switch/), David Large points out that:

> “New data from the [2024 Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/) reveals a striking 67% growth in static and hybrid website architectures among the top 10,000 most-visited sites.”

It’s great that brands are starting to realise the benefits of this approach – which David outlines. It’s positive for me too, as I’m all in with static sites and Cloudcannon.

Now [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/) has closed its doors, Jeremy Keith has kindly released his book [Going Offline](https://goingoffline.adactio.com/) – which is all about Service Workers – for free.

I enjoyed reading [Some thoughts on RSS and newsletters](https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/11/13/some-thoughts-on-rss-and-newsletters/) from Nicolas Magand, which, as it happens, I discovered via my RSS reader.

Two great articles on image alt text from the folks at Nielsen Norman Group: [Alt text: Not always needed](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/alt-text-usability/) and [Alt text: What to write](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/write-alt-text/).

I share loads of Leo Babauta’s posts from his website Zen Habits because it’s super useful and very actionable. Here’s another great one from Leo: [5 stoic and zen practices that I believe in](https://zenhabits.net/stoic/).

[AI is Eating Journalism, Education, and Creatives](https://hackernoon.com/ai-is-eating-journalism-education-and-creatives) from Dominic Ligot.

## What I’m up to in December

- Working through [Complete CSS](https://piccalil.li/complete-css/).
- Going skiing in Milton Keynes.
- Heading to Hamburg for a few days with family.
- Slowing down for the holidays.
- Celebrating Christmas.
- Reflecting on 2024.
