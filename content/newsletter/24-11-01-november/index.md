My goal is to publish this newsletter on the 1st of the month, but clearly that doesn’t always happen. Sometimes, when life gets busy, it goes out a few days later.

When this happens, I typically backdate the issue. So when you hit my [newsletter page](https://harrycresswell.com/newsletter/), everything appears perfectly consistent. But where’s the fun in that? From now on I’ll date these posts accurately. A true reflection of how it really is.


Anyway, as per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Watched [Mary Beard‘s Ultimate Rome: Empire without Limit](https://youtu.be/P3IIRiSTc3g?si=XYF8jCApbdNgfBSm), [Wild](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/) and [Ancient Apocalypse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22807484/) season 2.

Read [Material World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125937631-material-world) by Ed Conway and [A Fire Within](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39798154-a-fire-within) by Tomm DeLonge and AJ Hartley.

Celebrated Rebekka’s birthday with family and friends.

I ditch my old PDF CV for [a new CV page](https://harrycresswell.com/cv/) version.

Shared [HTML for the people](https://harrycresswell.com/links/html-for-people/).

## Elsewhere on the web

> “There is a whole generation of developers who no longer know how to build simple websites and web applications.” 

In [A lost generation](https://www.usecue.com/blog/a-lost-generation/), Joost points to [a Reddit thread where developers discuss the typical _client side heavy_  tech stack](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1g75r84/comment/lspai69/) and how it’s the main factor preventing companies from building wicked fast websites, like the one Wes Bos breaks down in the accompanying video.

[I’ve Been Doing Blockquotes Wrong](https://css-irl.info/ive-been-doing-blockquotes-wrong/). You’re not alone Michelle, I think it’s safe to say most of us have.

The newly revamped [Piccalil.li](https://piccalil.li/) is swiftly becoming my go-to for web development content. I recently discovered the excellent [Building a robust frontend using progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement) by Gov.uk from it.

Joeri Sebrechts’ hobby project [Plain Vanilla Web](https://plainvanillaweb.com/)  is “an explainer for doing web development using only vanilla techniques. No tools, no frameworks — just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.” I can’t wait to get stuck into this.

Here are couple of great posts about the power of personal websites: 

[On personal websites and social web](https://manuelmoreale.com/on-personal-websites-and-social-web), where Manu talks about how some are backing a new version of social media, and others are finding more deliberate way to be social online, and...

[Putting the “Person” in “Personal Website”](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/person-in-personal-website/), where Jim talks about how personal website  encourage you to look _inward_, whereas every social platform on the internet encourages you to look _outward_.

And a couple of important reads on AI:

[It’s the “1998” of the AI Revolution. So Why Can I Safely Ignore It?](https://theinternet.review/2024/10/29/generative-ai-2024-is-not-like-1998/). Jared White on how the AI Revolution, in particularly the rise of AI assistants, isn’t the cultural shift that it’s being hyped to be.

[Thinking about using AI?](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/publications/report-ai-environmental-impact/). A report on the environmental impact of AI from the folks at the Green Web Foundation.

## What I’m up to in November

- Reading and writing.
- Configuring Cloudcannon for the new Solar website I’ve been working on.
- Re-designing the [BuxtonThreeTwo](https://buxtonthreetwo.com/) website with B32’s James and Steph.
