Hey everyone,

Towards the end of last year I spent time travelling and focusing on other things, so it‚Äòs been a few months since I sent one of these. 

Now I‚Äôm back to it, I thought I‚Äôd return to this newsletter by making [a few changes](/writing/more-newsletter-changes/) ‚Äì a new format and a slightly different schedule.

I hope this will encourage me to share more about what I‚Äôm up to and what I‚Äôm currently working on. I‚Äôll continue to share posts from others in the section called ‚ÄúElsewhere on the web‚Äù. 

If this no longer appeals, then you‚Äôre welcome to [unsubscribe](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca), at any time.
