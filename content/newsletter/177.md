Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #177, it’s been a while, I know!

The past few months my focus has been occupied by a move from Germany back to the UK. With the pandemic and Brexit, it seems like a good time to simplify our lives and be in one place for a while.

On that note, I want to return to this email with the theme _Less is more_. Packing up for the move forced us to consider the importance of the things we own. We no longer have space for it all, so we had a big clear out of possessions that no longer serve us. It felt great to get rid of so much stuff.

I want to carry a similar mindset into life online, because so often I feel overwhelmed or distracted by all this stuff. Browser tabs, apps, bookmarks, feeds, tasks, the list goes on. 

With less stuff competing for my attention I feel less stressed. It’s easier to focus, and I find I create my best work.

Dan Eden on how the rise of remote work and the constant need to communicate is costing us valuable thinking time. [Thinking Is Work](https://daneden.me/blog/2021/thinking-is-work), so it’s important to get away from the screen, limit distractions and give your brain the time it needs to process information. After all, knowledge is often the primary capital.

We are flooding the present with so much content that we are diminishing our critical abilities to think, plan and design for the long term.” Gerry McGovern in [Do not track](https://gerrymcgovern.com/do-not-track/).

This month I want to leave you with a question to consider. 

What can you let go of to simplify your life, be more productive and feel less stressed?
