Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [Benjamin Wilkins](https://twitter.com/thatbenlifetho?lang=en), design technologist at Airbnb talks [design vocabulary, evolving ecosystems and AI-assisted prototyping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5XxgxBz3Fo) as ways to avoid the “shit work” in UI design.

2. [The Anatomy of a Thousand Typefaces](https://medium.com/@getflourish/the-anatomy-of-a-thousand-typefaces-f7b9088eed1) takes a look at [an impressive font classification tool](https://getflourish.github.io/anatomy-of-typefaces/app/) built by [Florian Schulz](https://medium.com/@getflourish), to provide more accurate analysis of web typography. Drill down on metrics like x-height, contrast, weight and width to help you make better type choices.

3. [A Mindful Design Process](https://headspace.design/a-mindful-design-process-f4a4641ee88f). [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) product designer [François Chartrand](https://twitter.com/frankchartrand) reveals ways to integrating mindfulness techniques to improve your design process.

4. [Do you Speak Human?](https://space10.io/labs/do-you-speak-human) is “a lab exploring conversational interfaces and AI, prototyping future applications that could positively influence how we interact with our technology and each other.” [Conversational form](https://space10-community.github.io/conversational-form/) is one of their projects you might already be familiar with. You can [read more about it here](https://medium.com/conversational-interfaces/introducing-the-conversational-form-c3166eb2ee2f).

5. For your ears: [Floating Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_Points) returns with [Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQqEbL5U8pA), following the short film and soundtrack [Reflections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI-kmzaCQWc), recorded with his band in the Mojave desert earlier this year.
