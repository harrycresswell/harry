Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #147, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

[Your output depends on your input](https://austinkleon.com/2019/12/19/your-output-depends-on-your-input/) from Austin Kleon.

[The Return of the 90s Web](https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/). Max Böck explores web technologies from the past that look like they might be making a comeback.

## Design and Code

[How Web Accessibility Works](https://blog.segunolalive.com/posts/how-web-accessibility-works/). Segun Ola explains the Accessibility Object Model (AOM) and Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA).

[Building a hexagonal grid using CSS grid](https://ninjarockstar.dev/css-hex-grids/). Jesse Breneman shows how to use CSS Grid and `clip-path` polygons to recreate familiar grids from tabletop war games, board games (Settlers of Catan, for instance), and computer games.

Speaking of which, [Stephen Barkan has recreated Catan in Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/829756731869897668)!

[CSS Custom Properties Fail Without Fallback](https://matthiasott.com/notes/css-custom-properties-fail-without-fallback). Mattias Ott continues his 100 day writing challenge with insight into how CSS properties don’t support the Cascade when a value is invalid.

[CSS :is() and :where() are coming to browsers](https://webplatform.news/issues/2020-06-04). Šime Vidas explains two new pseudo-classes.

## Typography

[A Practice for Everyday Life launches APFEL Type Foundry](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/a-practice-for-everyday-life-apfel-type-foundry-typography-graphic-design-110620). Launching with four retail typefaces and a bespoke service, the studio is hoping to continue its type-focused work “untethered” from its studio projects.

[Letters from Sweden release Inline](https://lettersfromsweden.se/font/inline/), their second collaboration with Stefania Malmsten. Inline is a companion to Line that also stands on its own. Where [Line](https://lettersfromsweden.se/font/line/) is a thin script with graffiti influences, Stefania got the idea for a typeface that would be the exact opposite of Line – a heavy face where the counter spaces in the characters would correspond to the different stroke weights in Line. Inline comes in three widths, with 7 optical sizes in each width, a total of 21 styles.

[The TypeLab for Typographics 2020](http://2020.typographics.com/typelab/) is a free 72-hour online event, with work­shops, demos, inter­views, experiments, and more. Livestreams of TypeLab events are free and publicly accessible on YouTube via one of our 3 international hosts ([Americas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2CJ5Lx_5hX6s11HAZvtkQg/), [Europe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG5VirYhodB4JlE6GsyWhmA), and [Asia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrnCK-zrOzRfIPSsU2Ncdg/))

## Something to watch

[CEO Jason Fried walkthroughs HEY](https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI), a fresh new take on email from Basecamp. HEY is unlike anything that's come before it and I absolutely love the design. Will this encourage other companies to rethink email? I hope so.

## From Twitter
