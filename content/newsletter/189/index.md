Hey everyone,

Welcome to Issue #189! 

I’ve just left Hamburg, where I’ve been for the past few days, mainly working and catching up with friends. Now we’re heading north, up near the Danish boarder, for our second wedding of the month.

It’s been a social month. I’ve also had lots of client work on, so I haven’t had much time for side projects, or writing, for that matter. But it’s the summer, and you can’t be too hard on yourself. Especially when you’re celebrating, travelling and enjoying other aspects of life – it’s all important.

Anyway, I hope you’re doing well and making time to enjoy life outside of work. 

Here are few links that caught my eye throughout the month of August.

## Thought provoking

“What matters is doing good work. Often, to do good work you need to work hard. And so people naturally conflate the two, thinking that what matters is working hard. But whether you work hard or not isn’t actually what’s important. What’s important is that you do good work.“ Jeremy Keith on [Work Ethics](https://adactio.com/journal/19392).

“Google’s judo move would’ve been to embrace the open web as a social network. Not *their*
 network but *our* network.“ Jim Nielsen in [The OG Social Network: Other People’s Websites](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/other-peoples-websites/).

“Simple is when it remains consistently reliable over time.“ Hardik Pandya in [Keep it simple](https://hvpandya.com/keeping-it-simple).

“Moving lightly through life is like hiking up a mountain not weighed down by burden, but with a spring in your step. It’s the feeling of joy of facing a brand new day, instead of the heaviness we might feel if we’re dreading things.“ Leo Babauta in [Moving Lightly Through the World](https://zenhabits.net/lightness/).
