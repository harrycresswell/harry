Lots happened in May, including a new Hugo release which brings a long-awaited new feature and plenty of rallying for the independent, human-centred web.

As usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

### Highlights from May

Published a post about the trend for [AI free, human-generated](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/ai-free/) content. Also [Reducing CSS](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/reducing-css/), which explains everything I’ve done to reduce the file size of my personal website styles by 33%. Then [Upgrading Hugo to 0.126.1](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/upgrading-hugo-warnings-breaking-changes/), which documents the minor issues I encountered when upgrading the the latest Hugo release.

Watched [A Murder at the end of the world](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15227418/), [Germany after the war 1945-1949](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcflnToTaWI&t=10s), [The Founder](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4276820/), [Clarkson’a Farm 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10541088/?ref_=ttep_ov_i), [House of Gucci](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11214590/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), [Beckham](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14524712/) and [Where the Crawdads Sing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9411972/).

Went to [When forms come alive](https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/art-exhibitions/when-forms-come-alive) at Hayward Gallery, then celebrated my dad’s birthday at Forza Wine in the National Theatre.

Spent the day at Kew Gardens and saw [Mark Quinn’s Light into Life](https://www.kew.org/kew-gardens/whats-on/marc-quinn). 

Made a few updates to my personal site by adding [a Blogroll](https://harrycresswell.com/blogroll/), some boring but important [licence information](https://harrycresswell.com/license/), then updating [my privacy page](https://harrycresswell.com/privacy/). 

Ran the [Hackney Half Marathon](https://www.hackneymoves.com/) in 2 hours 8 minutes. Not my quickest ever but perhaps the most enoyable.

Experienced a [Banya](https://banyalondon.co.uk/) for the first time, then went to [Gala festival](https://thisisgala.co.uk/) with a bunch of friends.

Read [Agent Sonya](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya) by Ben Macintyre.

### Elsewhere on the web

[We can have a different web](https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/). Molly White reminds us that the *good old days* of the web are still out there, but it’s up to us to bring them back.

I enjoyed Henry Desroches’s [Digital Frontiers, IndieWeb Cowboys, and A Place Online To Call Your Own](https://conf.11ty.dev/2024/digital-frontiers-indieweb-cowboys-and-a-place-online-to-call-your-own/) from 11ty Conf 2024. If you’re interested in IndieWeb principles and owning your content, then it’s well worth a watch.

[We need more calm companies](https://justinjackson.ca/calm-company). Justin Jackson calls for more profitable, purposeful businesses, that focus on sustainable growth and improving the lives of their customers and their employees, over frenzied growth and investor returns.

[Hugo 0.126.x: speedy pages from data](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2024/05/hugo-0-126-x-speedy-pages-data/). Bryce Wray highlights Content Adapters, the powerful new Hugo feature which allows pages to be built from remote data sources.

[Reviving an old project](https://blog.isak.me/reviving-an-old-project/). Isak has revived his 2000‘s inspired Hugo theme, which is now available to download from Hugo Themes. It also includes a few links to some pretty cool early-web inspired resources.

Michelle Barker has published a [Manifesto for a humane web](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/) which beyond defining what we should be aiming for, also points out that, as *citizens*, we all have our part to play in creating a better web. 

The results from the first ever [State of HTML survey](https://2023.stateofhtml.com/en-US) are now live. It’s great to see the least sexy, but most important part of the web getting the love it deserves. 

### What I’m up to in June

- Supporting England (and Germany) in the Euros.
- Working on [Eryn](https://studioeryn.com/) and [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/).
- [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)-ifying my personal site.
- Celebrating my 38th birthday.
- Various client projects.
- Migrating my Notion to Obsidian.
