The weather has been ideal here in the UK, the Euros are going strong, Glastonbury was as good as ever (though we only watched it on TV) – not a bad start to the summer I’d say.

Here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from June

Celebrated my birthday!

Watched [The Acolyte](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12262202/), [Becoming Karl Largerfeld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27052740/), a bunch of Euro 2024 games and a fair amount of Glastonbury.

Published [Slash pages and /slashes](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/slash-pages-and-slashes/).

Read [Agent Sonya by Ben Macintyre](https://benmacintyre.com/us/book/agent-sonya/) and made a start on [In Plain Sight by Ross Coulthart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57734614-in-plain-sight).

Took a few days holiday and spent the day in Rye, followed by a couple of nights at [Tillingham](https://tillingham.com/) in the Sussex countryside.

> When local news is hollowed out, when vital beats are neglected, when algorithms are spammed with generative nonsense, audiences that crave relevance or humanity will naturally gravitate to the outlets that offer something real.

> Smarter people than me are coming up with ways to protect content through sabotage: hidden pixels in images; hidden words on web pages...If enough people do this we’ll probably end up in an arms race with the bots. It’ll be like reverse SEO. Instead of trying to trick crawlers into liking us, let’s collectively kill ’em.
