Hi folks,

I’m back after the Summer break with a few useful links from around the web.

## Thought provoking

[A new look for Mailchimp](https://twitter.com/Mailchimp/status/1045088136697704448) (also [here](https://mailchimp.com/resources/new-brand-announcement-2018/)). With the help of branding agency [Collins](https://www.wearecollins.com/), Mailchimp has introduced a redesign of their logo, a fresh new color palette, new illustrations and an analog typeface from the 1920s as it’s new typeface.

## Design and Code

## Typography

[Nick Sherman made a cool variable font](https://twitter.com/NickSherman/status/1045406974601441280) + responsive design interpretation of an old Dutch tin designed circa 1930 by Jacob Jongert.

## Something to watch

I binged all 10 episodes of [Maniac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6cDDmk-O5A) on Netflix and loved it.
