Hi everyone,

Welcome to Issue #190. 

Last week I had a million things to do, before setting off for a few months of travelling. So I’m only just finding the time to send this issue now.

I’m currently in Greece, where I’ll be for the next couple of weeks. Working on bits and pieces, rekindling personal projects and making the most of the last of the good weather. After what has been a busy couple of months, I’m rather enjoying being back in the slow lane, again.

Here’s what I discovered during the month of September.
