My RSS reader has been packed full of posts about AI this past month. As I learn more about the detrimental costs I’m beginning to pay closer attention. In this issue I have a couple of excellent reads on the subject.

As usual, here are my highlights from April, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month of May.


## Highlights from April

Watched [The 3 Body Problem](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13016388/), [Past Lives](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13238346/) and [All the Light We Cannot See](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15320362/). 

Rewrote the CSS on my personal site, reducing file size by 33% all without any changes to the overall design. I have a post about the process coming soon.

Spent time in Bremen, hit the cinema to see [Dune: Part Two](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/) and visited the [Buddhismus exhibition](https://www.uebersee-museum.de/sonderausstellung-buddhismus/) at the Ebersee Museum.

Celebrated my sisters birthday and hosted friends and family visiting from Germany.

Read [The Minimalist Entrepreneur](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56913172-the-minimalist-entrepreneur) by Sahil Lavingia.

## Elsewhere on the web

> “Researchers have assessed that generating a single AI image requires the same amount of energy needed to [fully charge your iPhone battery](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/05/1084417/ais-carbon-footprint-is-bigger-than-you-think/). Training an AI model also requires “626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of around 300 round-trip flights between New York and San Francisco—nearly five times the lifetime emissions of the average car.“ 

[How AI Cheapens Design (At a Great Ecological Cost)](https://thedieline.com/how-ai-cheapens-design-at-a-great-ecological-cost/) by John P. Kazior.

[AI isn't useless. But is it worth it?](https://www.citationneeded.news/ai-isnt-useless/). A fantastic read from Molly White on the potential benefits and very real costs of AI.

In [The Wabi Sabi Web](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-8/the-wabi-sabi-web/), Tom Greenwood explores how the Japanese philosophy that values imperfection and impermanence beauty might help us rethink design and create a healthier relationship with the digital products we use every day.

[Help us invent CSS Grid Level 3, aka “Masonry” layout](https://webkit.org/blog/15269/help-us-invent-masonry-layouts-for-css-grid-level-3/).  Jen Simmons calls designers to join the debate on how this long requested feature should be implemented in CSS. Have your say and let’s get those bricks in the browser.

[Empty Space](https://tightwad.neocities.org/empty-space/). A short but thoughtful post from Tightwad, about the often opposing viewpoints of designer and stakeholder.

## What I’m up to in May

- Various client projects.
- Writing content for [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/).
- Running the Hackney Half.
- Migrating my Notion to Obsidian.
