Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #136, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

”All change brings opportunity. Some change gives us the opportunity to pause and ask what we can do better. How can we better connect to what has proven to be important?” [What You Truly Value](https://fs.blog/2020/03/find-what-you-truly-value/) by Shane Parrish

“Right now, we have more ways to communicate about what matters than ever before. Give humans a bunch of symbols, and we will find a way to make them say what we mean.”

Jennifer Daniel in [Talk to Me: The Evolution of Emoji](https://design.google/library/the-evolution-of-emoji/).

## Design and Code

[Building an Interactive Timetable](https://css-irl.info/building-an-interactive-timetable/). An awesome project from Michelle Barker designed to keep some semblance of routine during these strange times we’re living through. The tool randomly sorts fun games and activities to be played at home.

As a big Notion user (I use it for almost everything) I was excited to find this [Web Performance Checklist](https://css-tricks.com/web-performance-checklist/), an open source Notion doc from Robin Rendle.

[Styling Scrollbars with CSS: The Modern Way to Style Scrollbars](https://alligator.io/css/css-scrollbars/). It’s easier than you might think!

[How to create an accordion hover effect with box-shadows](https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/css-box-shadow-animation/). Great tutorial from Sarah Fossheim who shows how to use the box-shadow property to create a layered card component, and animate it on hover.

[J](http://jamstackthemes.dev)[amstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/). A list of themes and starters for JAMstack sites from Stackbit.com.

## Typography

”I wanted to build a structure that other people could easily build off of.” Froyo Tam in [Open Source Fonts Are Love Letters to the Design Community](https://www.wired.com/story/open-source-fonts-love-letters-design-community/). An interesting read on the rise of open source design and typefaces that can be freely used and modified.

[Font Match](https://font-match.netlify.com/) from Markos Konstantopoulos, lets you compare fonts by overlaying them on top of each other.

A great introduction to [The typographic scale](http://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/) from Spencer Mortensen.

[Typefaces which are all about having fun and good spacing: Ohno respects history without reinventing the wheel](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/ohno-graphic-design-260320).

[Sprat](https://github.com/EthanNakache/Sprat-type) is a new variable display font from Ethan Nakache, available in 18 styles. It features long sharp serifs and a high contrast between thin and thick, a very high crossbar and a round design for the curves. The font is open source and free to download.

## Something to watch

[Let's Learn CSS Grid!](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/let-s-learn-css-grid) In this episode, of Learn with Jason, Rachel Andrew – the driving force behind Grid‘s spec & adoption — teaches us how to get started.

## Content (from me)

A few notes on [Processing JSON from the command line with jq](https://harrycresswell.com/notes/process-json-data-with-jq/).
