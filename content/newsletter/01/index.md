Hey Folks,

Welcome to the first ever email.

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. I discovered the work of [Matej Latin](http://matejlatin.co.uk/) quite recently. He’s lead UX at Autotrader but spends a good part of his free time working on awesome side projects. We had a quick chat last week on [twitter](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell) about his latest project [Better Web Type](https://betterwebtype.com/). It’s a free 10 part email course on everything typography. Well worth checking it out if type is your thing. Really digging [his writing](http://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2016/11/03/my-sketches-arent-perfect/) too.

2. ["Make Good Art"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAb-NYkseI). This is [Neil Gaiman](http://www.neilgaiman.com/About_Neil) laying it down to the UAL grads of 2012. A nice little reminder that none of us really know what the hell we’re up to. Just picture your mountain and keep heading towards it, one step at a time. It will all make sense sooner or later. Check out [my sketchnotes](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell/status/855354480996614144) on the talk if you don't have 20mins to spare.

3. My great pal Georgie Lucas got me on to [Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/) a few weeks back. If you struggle to focus this app is a real game changer. Who would have thought background noise helps boost your productivity. Here’s [my current favourite](https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/PgzzuzLldGQD9Jb) configuration, I’m calling it “Campfire Drone”.

4. [5 ways Ben Franklin shaped Elon Musk’s world view](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/19/5-things-we-can-learn-from-one-of-elon-musks-favorite-books.html). Let’s all agree Elon _is_ [the world’s raddest man](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html). Anything Elon is always worth a read, this one will only take a few minutes.That's it for now, thanks for reading.
