Hi folks,

A few links I felt were worth sharing this week...

## Thought provoking

[Climate change is unraveling this Antarctic ecosystem](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/11/antarctica-climate-change-western-peninsula-ice-melt-krill-penguin-leopard-seal/) by Craig Welch

[The Math Behind The 5-Hour Rule: Why You Need To Learn 1 Hour Per Day Just To Stay Relevant](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-math-behind-the-5-hour-rule-why-you-need-to-learn-1-hour-per-day-just-to-stay-relevant-90007efe6861?inf_contact_key=03c3725defc246a1d3645c3d42c0abc1b2d11af133ed95216559a98bddf96de9) from Michael Simmons

## Design and Code

_“Intrinsic Web Design: belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing.”_

In [Everything You Know About Web Design Just Changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20QKda7IhJQ) Jen Simmons talks about where we’ve come from with web layout and where we’re heading in the Intrinsic Web Design era.

Oliver Schöndorfer on [Implementing a variable font with fallback web fonts](https://www.zeichenschatz.net/typografie/implementing-a-variable-font-with-fallback-web-fonts.html)

[Dash for IOS](https://kapeli.com/dash_ios) a useful tool which gives you offline access to 200+ API documentation sets.

## Typography

[Structural Typography – Type as both language and composition](https://medium.com/s/about-face/structural-typography-26f00c19e2f0?mc_cid=9e3584fa25&mc_eid=60d364abd9) by Bethany Heck

[GT Zirkon](http://gt-zirkon.com/) – named after the second hardest crystal that exists, is a new san serif from Grilli Type which freely mixes historical and contemporary ideas. It was created by Tobias Rechsteiner over a nine year period.

## Something to watch

In [What if He Falls?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-wjmIFlnNo) filmmakers Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin take us inside the process of documenting Alex Honnold’s quest for climbing glory — and the ethical calculus of filming a friend who could, with the slip of a finger, plummet to his death.
