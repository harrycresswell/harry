Hey everyone,

Here’s this weeks roundup of what’s new in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

[The decisions journey](https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-decisions-journey). Mattias Ott on how prototyping can help you make better decisions and narrow down the endless possibilities.

“Your role as a designer is to understand and communicate the impact of every change to your team, so you can collectively make more informed decisions.” In [Honestly, it depends](https://uxdesign.cc/honestly-it-depends-a805418e21bb) Fabricio Teixeira shares some insight in the best way to approach design changes.

## Design and Code

[Extending Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/extending-atomic-design/). Brad Frost revisits his methodology after 6 years to see how newer design system concepts such as subatomic design and design tokens interact with atomic design.

[Frontend design, react, and a bridge over the great divide](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/), also from Brad Frost, this time on his struggles and learnings in component based React JS.

Ash Stevens on [Bringing new CSS techniques to production](https://sidigital.co/blog/bringing-new-css-techniques-to-production).

[How we built a component library that people actually enjoy using](https://medium.com/styled-components/how-to-build-a-great-component-library-a40d974a412d). Chase McCoy shares the tools and techniques used to build the Sprout Social design system.

## Typography

Liz Stinson on [A Typeface Designed to Look Like Speed.](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/a-typeface-designed-to-look-like-speed/) Flight Center Gothic’s deep slant captures the Jet Age.

[Building a design system](https://uxdesign.cc/building-a-design-system-where-to-start-part-4-typography-5065b8d360c). Shane P Williams takes a closer look at the typography step in building a solid design system.

## Something to watch

Pablo Stanley and Ran Segall discuss the [pros and cons of working as a remote designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1jW1cownzE).

I’ll be out of your inbox now until August. I’m taking the next couple of weeks off and driving the van from Hamburg to the UK for some hiking in Northumberland and the Lake District.

Until then, thanks for reading.
