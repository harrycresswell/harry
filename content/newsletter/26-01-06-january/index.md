Happy New Year!

Hopefully you’ve enjoyed some time off over the holidays, you’re feeling well rested and ready for another new year.

I’ve just returned from Bavaria, where I’ve been enjoying some time with friends in the mountains and making the most of all the snow. This one may feel a little light for that reason. It’s cold outside, it’s the first week back to it, so I expect it will take some time to find my rhythm again.

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Skied our final session of the year at the [Milton Keynes Snozone](https://snozoneuk.com/).

Went to [Drumsheds](https://drumshedslondon.com/) for the first time to see Stephan Bodzin and Paul Kalkbrenner. 

Stayed in Illmington with family and had a lovely few days exploring the Cotswolds.

Celebrated Christmas with family in London.

Stayed with a friend in Bavaria, went [ice skating on a frozen lake](/now/25-12-30/) and skiing in Leogang, Austria.
