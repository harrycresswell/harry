Hi folks,

A few links I felt were worth sharing this week...

## Thought provoking

[How to remember what you learn](https://youtu.be/V-UvSKe8jW4) from Will Schoder.

## Design and Code

José Torre shares [10 Skills that make a great designer](https://uxdesign.cc/10-skills-that-make-a-great-designer-5e1e1f43fa0c).

[Everything I Learned in Design School](https://www.degreeless.design/), a well presented list of resources from Tregg Frank.

The [State of JavaScript 2018](https://2018.stateofjs.com/) surveys over 20,000 JavaScript developers to find out what they’re using, what they’re happy with, and what they want to learn.

## Typography

[The Mystery Font That Took Over New York](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/21/nyregion/new-york-storefronts-mystery-font.html) by Ramsey Taylor.

Bethany Heck reviews [Windsor](http://fontreviewjournal.com/windsor/) the typeface of British origin that’s found its way into the “Ugly American” vernacular.

## Something to watch

[Orbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjs6fnpPWy4) is a real time reconstruction of time lapse photography taken on board the International Space Station. Stunning visuals of our home, accompanied by music from [Phaeleh](https://phaeleh.co.uk/).
