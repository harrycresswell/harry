Hi Folks,

Here’s this weeks hoard of noteworthy links from around the internet...

## Thought provoking

“Elegant simplifiers create designs that are crystal clear.”

_“In our modern world, it’s easy to junk things up. Simple is hard. We’re quick to add more questions to research surveys, more buttons to a digital interface, more burdens to people.”_

_“[Good design] guides the user toward the objective, without distraction. Good design is transparent.”_

Kate Clayton in [Be an Elegant Simplifier](https://behavioralscientist.org/be-an-elegant-simplifier/?ref=heydesigner).

## Design and Code

[The Design Process: What is the Double Diamond?](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond) Designers across disciplines share strikingly similar approaches to the creative process, Design Council have mapped this out as ‘the Double Diamond’.

A few good reads on designing forms: Firstly, [Don’t get clever with login forms](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/dont-get-clever-with-login-forms/) from Brad Frost, then [Please stop building inaccessible forms](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/please-stop-building-inaccessible-forms-and-how-to-fix-them-72c59e2729c6) from Kent C Dodds and finally, [21 ways Typeform uses typeforms](https://www.typeform.com/blog/inside-story/21-ways-typeform-uses-typeforms/) by Eric Johnson.

## Typography

Sia Karamalegos on [Making Google fonts load faster](https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d).

To add some warmth to the Originals collection, Adobe recently released [Adobe Handwriting](https://theblog.adobe.com/fonts-with-a-personal-touch), a trio of fonts based on the handwriting of some Adobe designers.

## Something to watch
