I’m currently in Hamburg visiting old friends and meeting new arrivals. We grabbed pizza last night from the usual spot and sat by the Alster with a Gösser NaturRadler. It’s good to be back, especially with this great weather we’ve been having lately. 

Tomorrow we head to Schleswig-Holstein to see R’s family and celebrate her aunt and uncles 50th wedding anniversary. Should be a good chance to practice my German! 

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Published [CSS Naked Day](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/css-naked-day/), [Subscribe to RSS feeds by topic](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/subscribe-rss-feeds-by-topic/) and [How to set up a Hugo menu in Cloudcannon](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/hugo-menus-in-cloudcannon/).

Had two of my posts featured in [April’s Hugo Conf newsletter](http://22461532.hs-sites.com/content-adapters-partials-and-shortcodes-more-hugo-community-tips?ecid=ACsprvsNhQHDuQYiv5TNGqd7CVw_iPMdkzptEpZJC7kfsiOrCMfDV_I341Yx19UeMPUQbaM0Hy83&utm_campaign=HugoConf&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_wbHbIvs-wLc0SrE1H8fFqKbHbELKs-GrvCYnm5SuR6_beUjXhT5DpAIDJhI43didMvwshxsJr-e6eiA89IPzSPiS-xw0xbLknKjPl4Xqnf7VmOF0&_hsmi=355889746&utm_content=355889746&utm_source=hs_email), curated by David Large at Cloudcannon. 

Added multilingual mode and a work section to [R’s website](https://rebekkawrites.com/work/), then made a bunch of other minor improvement to the code.

Spent the Easter weekend celebrating my sisters birthday with family in Warwickshire.

Landed a handful of 360’s at Snozone park day with my brother.

Watched [Adolescence](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31806037/), [Andor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9253284/) and [The Last of Us](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/).

## Elsewhere on the web

Having participated in [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.org/) for the first time this year, I thought I’d share a few posts (far better than my own) which highlight exactly why it’s becoming such an important digital event: 

[Digital Striptease, Or, How I Learned to Love My `<body>`](https://theinternet.review/2025/04/09/digital-striptease/) from The Internet Review (Jared White).

> “...we should all strive to publish Web sites in ways which are most useful for humans. By keeping HTML simple, using semantic tags as much as possible, and avoiding unnecessary complications in the structure of our Web pages, we give “user agents” (aka Web browsers) the tools they need to serve their users well.”

[Why I participated in CSS Naked Day](https://chrisburnell.com/article/why-css-naked-day/) from Chris Burnell.

> “...progressive enhancement can start all the way back at the inception of HTML and we can think of CSS itself as a progressive enhancement: we should aim to get as much of what the page wants to achieve just through carefully-crafted HTML.”

David Perell offers some [interesting thoughts on writing in the age of AI](https://x.com/david_perell/status/1894143267878703562).

> “The more a piece of writing comes from personal experience, the less it’s likely to be overtaken by AI. Personal writing, like biographies and memoirs, aren’t going away anytime soon. That's because people have data about their lives that LLMs don’t have.”

[I’m getting fed up of making the rich, richer](https://bell.bz/im-getting-fed-up-of-making-the-rich-richer/) from Andy Bell.

Feeling Andy’s plans to work more in the open by sharing the entire process for future Set Studio projects. Also how he’s keen to do as much good work as possible by supporting progressive movements. We need more agencies with this mindset.

An interesting post on how to create [Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders](https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/) from Lean Rada.

Michelle Barker on [Creating CSS Theme Variables from a JS file](https://css-irl.info/creating-css-variables-from-a-js-file/).

## What I’m up to in May

- Working on Practical Hugo and Eryn.
- Various client projects
- Attending Figma Config.
- More skiing with my brother.
