Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #103, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

[Forget the computer — here’s why you should write and design by hand](https://uxdesign.cc/forget-the-computer-heres-why-you-should-write-and-design-by-hand-19031089138f) from Herbert Lui.

[All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people](https://medium.com/@bellmar/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f) by Marianne Bellotti.

## Design and Code

[Best practices for prototyping keyboard accessibility](https://theblog.adobe.com/best-practices-for-prototyping-keyboard-accessibility/) from Oliver Lindberg.

Rachel Andrew on the importance of [Writing Modes and CSS layout](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/writing-modes-layout/).

[Native lazy-loading for the web](https://web.dev/native-lazy-loading). Browser-level native lazy-loading is finally here!

## Typography

[The birth of Inter: How the new open-source typeface used by GitHub and Mozilla came to be](https://www.figma.com/blog/the-birth-of-inter/). An intersting interview with designer Rasmus Andersson.

Unit Editions ask [Designers pick their favourite Letraset typeface](https://www.uniteditions.com/blogs/news/ten-designers-pick-their-favourite-letraset-typeface), the majority of which feature in [Letraset: The DIY Typography Revolution](https://www.uniteditions.com/products/letraset-the-diy-typography-revolution).

[Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) – a “slightly whimsical” open source programming font with cursive italics. A nice alternative to the fantastic but pricey font of choice; [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator).

## Something to watch

[Ooops, I guess we're full-stack developers now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjXUGFQjYg). A talk by Chris Coyier.
