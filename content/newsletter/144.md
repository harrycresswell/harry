Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #144, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“They’d call it interactive architecture, sure, but then they’d refer to it with a different name: *responsive* architecture. A light went off in my head. *Responsive* felt right for what I was trying to describe: layouts that would just *know* the best way to fit on a user’s screen.”

Ethan Marcotte reflects on the origins of responsive design, as the concept he coined turns 10 years old.
