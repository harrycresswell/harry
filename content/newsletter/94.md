Hey everyone,

Here’s your weekly roundup of what’s new in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

[Ownership is resistance](https://pjrvs.com/own/). What we do not own, we do not have sovereignty over. A poignant read from Paul Jarvis.

## Design and Code

Varun Vachhar on [What is a design system?](https://varun.ca/what-is-a-design-system/)

[Coherent, not consistent](https://uxdesign.cc/coherent-not-consistent-b44244dadec4). Bruno Bergher on why consistency in UI Design is overvalued.

A fantastic post from Sara Soueidan on [Accessible Icon Buttons](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accessible-icon-buttons/).

[Can’t Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/). A fun game to strengthen your UI design skills. Select the design that looks correct. The further you get the hard it becomes.

## Typography

[Google fonts is adding font-display](https://www.zachleat.com/web/google-fonts-display/). For more on what this means [check out this short explainer](https://font-display.glitch.me/) by Monica Dinculescu.

[enFont Terrible](https://enfont-terrible.glitch.me/). Drag and drop a font file and move the sliders until you are happy with the result, then click Create font and a weird new font will be generated for you.

## Something to watch

[Taking back your web](https://www.webrocker.de/2019/05/16/take-back-your-web-tantek-celik-beyond-tellerrand-conference-duesseldorf-2019/), a talk by Tantek Çelik.
