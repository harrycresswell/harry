Happy New Year! 

I hope you’ve all had a positive start to 2024. 

It’s taken a few days to get back into the flow of things, so this one’s out a little later than I planned. I’ll try and hit publish on the 1st going forward.

Anyway, here’s what I got up to in December, a few things from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from December

- Moved into our new house!
- Launched a new thing - [cu.css](https://ciu.harrycresswell.com/) – and published a [a post introducing the project](/writing/introducing-cu-css/).
- Published my [review of 2023](/writing/2023-review/)
- Read [The Conspiracy Tourist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122077811-the-conspiracy-tourist) by Dom Joly.
- Enjoyed the 2 Christmas parties – oh the joy of being freelance!
- Spent valuable time with family, colleagues and friends.

## Elsewhere on the web

- [Getting started with Web Performance](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2023/14/) from Alistair Shepherd is a really great resource which includes a bunch of course, books and blogs for taking your knowledge further. As is [Ten optimisation tips for an initial web performance audit](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2023/ten-optimisation-tips-for-an-initial-web-performance-audit/) also from Alistair.
- [Preparing For Interaction To Next Paint, A New Web Core Vital](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/12/preparing-interaction-next-paint-web-core-vital/) from Geoff Graham. In March 2024, Interaction to Next Paint will formally replace First Input Delay as a Core Web Vital metric.
- [You don't need JavaScript for that](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2023/2/) from Kilian Valkhof.
- [Things I learned in 2023](https://carlbarenbrug.com/learning) from Carl Barenbrug.
- [Untools: Tools for better thinking](https://untools.co/). A collection of thinking tools and frameworks to help you solve problems, make decisions and understand systems.
- [CSS only "scroll-to-top"](https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/css-only-scroll-to-top/) from Stefan Judis. A nifty trick to build a “scroll to top” component.

## What I’m up to in January

- Migrating [buxtonthreetwo.com](https://buxtonthreetwo.com) over to Hugo and Cloudcannon.
- Working on a bunch of [cu.css](https://cu.harrycresswell.com/) post launch improvements
- Picking up where I left off with [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/).
- Working Mew app v2.0.4
- Writing about my OKR setup in Obsidian
