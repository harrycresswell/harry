Spring has arrived here in London. I love it and I hate it. We’re finally back out in the garden, enjoying the longer evenings. But I’m also constantly sneezing thanks to all the tree pollen in the air.

March was a good one. I took some time off for holiday, but also managed to knuckle down and make serious progress with side projects.

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Spent a week skiing in the French Alps with a big group of friends. 15 of us this year. It was a lot of fun. Here’s a picture of [Rebekka and I at the top of the glacier](https://harrycresswell.com/now/25-03-15/).

## Elsewhere on the web

[The Social Media Mirage](https://carlbarenbrug.com/social-mirage) from Carl Barenbrug. 

> “The humble email. The most underrated, yet most reliable way to reach an audience—through the direct, unfiltered power of a newsletter. No interference, no restrictions, no risk of vanishing from their feed.”

While social media falls, email and RSS are here to stay.

[The disease of more](https://www.lifeafterthedailygrind.com/p/the-disease-of-more) from Richard.

> “The way forward isn’t _more_, it’s _less_. Less news, less noise, less busyness, less mindless communication, fewer endless choices. More slowness, more presence, more clarity.
> 
> Only by stepping back can we reclaim our minds, be ourselves—and be free.”

I always stop scrolling my RSS reader when I spot a post from Richard. This is a fascinating read about how technological advances increase efficiency whilst reducing productivity.

[Big Tech Wants You Trapped. The Open Web Sets You Free](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/big-tech-wants-you-trapped-the-open-web-sets-you-free-2/) from Joan Westenberg.

> “When you post content exclusively on these platforms, you build their asset, not yours. When your audience exists only within their ecosystem, you depend on their permission to reach people. When your digital identity lives inside their databases, you surrender control of your online presence. And when your online presence is an innate part of your identity, you're sacrificing everything.”

Now’s the time to do something about it. Get off Big Tech platforms, join the open web and regain your ownership, governance and independence.

[Enshittification as a matter of taste](https://daverupert.com/2025/03/enshittification-has-a-flavor/) from Dave Rupert.

> “Going forward, I think taste and style are more valuable than ever before. In an era where we’re able to rapidly generate cheap low quality content or software at a scale we’ve never seen before, we will need people with taste in the mix.”

[The environmental impact of the web we build](https://gomakethings.com/the-environmental-impact-of-the-web-we-build/) from Chris Ferdinandi. 

> “...small acts of resistance can inspire bigger change, like ripples spreading out over a pond.”

[Carousels with CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/carousels-with-css) are on their way. In this post Adam Argyle explains how they work and shares a bunch of demos.

## What I’m up to in April

- Working hard to get the first season of Practical Hugo over the line.
- Making a bunch of improvements to Rebekka’s personal website.
- Celebrating my sisters birthday (and Easter) together with family.
- Skiing with my brother at Milton Keynes Snozone.
- Starting a new client project.
