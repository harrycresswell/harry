Hi folks,

Here are a few links I felt were worth sharing this week.

## Thought provoking

[You Won’t Stay Motivated On Your Goals If You Don’t Follow These 7 Principles](https://medium.com/@nicolascole77/you-wont-stay-motivated-on-your-goals-if-you-don-t-follow-these-7-principles-65eccab7af8b) by Nicolas Cole.

[Beguiling Photographs of Pancakes Cast As Moons](https://hyperallergic.com/422713/nadine-schlieper-robert-pufleb-alternative-moons/) Can a book of pancake photographs lead you to question the power of images in general?

## Design and Code

## Typography

## Something to watch

In his Ted talk [How I climbed a 3000ft verticle cliff - without ropes](https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_honnold_how_i_climbed_a_3_000_foot_vertical_cliff_without_ropes%20), Alex Honnald explains how he used visualisation, preparation and dedication to master free solo climbing.

[Jimmy Chin](https://www.instagram.com/jimmy_chin/) made a documentary about Alex’s climb for National Geographic called [Free Solo](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/films/free-solo/about/).
