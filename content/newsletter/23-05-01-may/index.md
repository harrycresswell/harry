Hi everyone,

I hope you’re doing well.
 
This is my final month of training before the Hackney Half Marathon, so I’ve been running quite a bit. 

I wasn’t planning on running until a friend broke her knee and was forced to pull out. So I’m running on her behalf and I’m enjoying training for it. 

I’m getting into these longer runs. The feeling and clarity you get from them is something special. They also happen to be a great way to explore the city and find new spots you otherwise wouldn’t have thought to visit.

Anyway, here’s the latest.
