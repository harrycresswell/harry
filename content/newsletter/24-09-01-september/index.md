It’s a peaceful Sunday morning here in south London. We’re in for another hot one. Could be the last of the summer. I’m off to the Chelsea Palace game shortly, but before I do that I have things to share.

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from August

Watched [Clara](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6613878/), [Arrival](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/), [Alien Romulus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18412256/) and [Griselda](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15837600/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_2_nm_6_in_0_q_Griselda).

Published [Exploring Hugo’s new starter theme and updates to the `new site` command](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/exploring-hugos-new-theme/), [Blog Posts vs. Social Posts](https://harrycresswell.com/links/blog-posts-vs-social-posts/) a quick response to Jim’s post of the same name.

Released [cu.css v0.1.7](https://github.com/harrycresswell/cu/releases/tag/v0.1.7) which fixes updates a few depreciated methods, adds Every Layout’s Frame for controlling aspect ratio of media content and a few other improvements.

Read [The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafón](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1232.The_Shadow_of_the_Wind), started [Imminent by Luis Elizondo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210963085-imminent).

Took a trip to North London to see [Four Tet playing in Finsbury Park](https://www.instagram.com/fourtetkieran/p/Cv49NqKI17a/?img_index=1).

Celebrated my brothers 26th birthday and caught up with a bunch of his friends.


## Elsewhere on the web

> It will no longer be enough to blog in order to merely “put out content”. The key will be what has always been key to great blogging: expressing your unique, inimitable impression.

[The Impressionist Blogging Movement](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/impressionist-blogging/). Jim Nielsen reflects on how blogging might change with the dominance of AI.

Heydon Pickering provides possibly the best, and wittiest, explanation of the [The anchor element](https://heydonworks.com/article/the-anchor-element/) you’re likely to ever read.

While we‘re on the subject of anchor tags....

> A link, on the open internet, is a vote. It’s your way of saying, “_this is great, and more people should know about it._” We talk about how much power the search engines have, but if you think about it, the search engines listen to us. They see what we link to, what we click, and how long we stay.* At the end of the day, _we_ are the curators of what gets surfaced on the internet.

Bryan Braun in [The Power of a Link](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/10/03/the-power-of-a-link/).

I enjoyed reading about [the process behind the redesign of the Piccalilli website](https://piccalil.li/blog/redesigning-piccalilli-the-first-part-of-the-design-process/) by Andy Bell and the team from Set studio.

An interesting read on [Pricing Projects As A Freelancer Or Agency Owner](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/08/pricing-projects-freelancer-agency-owner/) from Paul Boag. Personally, I use the time and materials approach (a day/hourly rate), break projects into phases, and use a brief discovery session to create estimates for each phase. I find this helps put clients at ease while remaining flexible. [Dave Smyth’s Day rates](https://davesmyth.com/day-rates) post was a big influence.

[State of CSS 2024](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-css/2024) survey is now open. Make a contribution to the future of CSS!


## What I’m up to in September

- Launching a new multilingual Hugo site for a Psychotherapist based in Hamburg.
- Finishing up the visual identity for a Virginia based cabinet maker.
- Travelling to Hamburg to celebrate a friends birthday.
- Travelling to Croatia for a couple of weeks holiday.
