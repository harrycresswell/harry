Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #140, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“Scaling requires a great level of empathy and seeing your work through the eyes of your collaborators.” [A systems view of brand design](https://dropbox.design/article/a-systems-view-of-brand-design). Brand Designer Pedro del Corro talks to Design Director Jessica Svendsen about the task of creating and maintaining design systems at Dropbox Brand Studio.

[“The title ‘Front-End Developer’ is obsolete.”](https://css-tricks.com/the-title-front-end-developer-is-obsolete/) Chris Coyier has his say about [an interesting Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/bdc/status/1249597086007345157?s=20) from Benjamin De Cock.

## Design and Code

“If you’re using a framework to build your site, you’re making a trade-off in terms of initial performance—even in the best of scenarios.” Tim Kadlec in [The Cost of Javascript Frameworks](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/).

[“Masonry” Grids are being tested in Firefox Nightly, behind a feature flag](https://twitter.com/MiriSuzanne/status/1255567501359853570). This is really exciting and means in the near future we might finally have native support for one of the more tricky patterns to implement.

In his new article [Color theme switcher](https://mxb.dev/blog/color-theme-switcher/), Max Böck takes dark themes to the next level by showing us how to build ten dynamic color themes.

[What is a resilient website?](https://aquestionofcode.com/60-what-is-a-resilient-website-jeremy-keith/) Jeremy Keith talks to A Question of Code podcast about progressive enhancement and what makes a great website.

[Sarah Drasner creates a Hero Generator](https://hero-generator.netlify.app/) to automate the repetitive task of writing the html and CSS needed for the infamous hero pattern.

## Typography

[Times New Arial](https://timesnewarial.liebermannkiepereddemann.de/) is a variable font concept by Liebermann Kiepe Reddemann, which uses interpolation to combine the two visual extremes of a classic serif and a classic grotesque into one hybrid font.

Malou Verlomme has made [Macklin's complete superfamily available for free as variable fonts](https://twitter.com/MalouVerlomme/status/1255518635860295682), for one week starting from 29th April.

[Accessible Font Sizing, Explained](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-font-sizing-explained/). What sort of best practices can we rely on to make for an accessible reading experience? Andrés Galante has the answers.

[How Femme Type found the hidden women of typography within a year](https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/27-april-3-may-2020/femme-type-one-year/). Amber Weaver, the designer behind the organisation, speaks to Design Week and reflects on a year of celebrating women in typography.

## Something to watch

Jason Lengstorf and Thor Schaeff teach us how to [build an ecommerce store on the Jamstack using Stripe Checkout and Netlify Functions](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/sell-products-on-the-jamstack) in this episode of Learn with Jason. You can also read the [in-depth tutorial over on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/13/learn-how-to-accept-money-on-jamstack-sites-in-38-minutes/).

## Content (from me)

[Accessibility check your writing on macOS](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/accessibility-checking-writing-mac-os/). If you’re running Mac Sierra or above, this quick fun tip will help you make your writing more inclusive.

## From Twitter

[Web development became so complex](https://twitter.com/EvaldasBu/status/1255933410247401473). As a huge advocate for building static sites, this tweet from Evaldas Burlingis about making simpler choices caught my eye this week.
