[Braintactics](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca) 🤯 is a weekly roundup of articles, tools and tips for product designers and front-end developers. Given a good internet connection I send it once a week, on a Friday morning.

## What topics does it cover?

Expect to find anything related to designing and building things for the web. Topics range from design and web development, to typography, writing, process and productivity.

Recently I’ve included interesting things on:

- HTML and CSS fundamentals
- Building component libraries
- Designing accessible color systems
- Learning CSS grid and flexbox
- Building JAMStack / Serverless websites
- Variable fonts and open source typography
- Creating generative artwork with code

## What’s the format?

Each week I usually begin with one or two thought provoking reads – maybe an article or a quote from a book I’m reading. These may not directly relate to design and development, but dig a little deeper and you should find some helpful lessons to apply to your work.

For the most part of the email you’ll find links on design and code as you might expect and a section reserved especially for links about typography.

Oliver Reichenstein once said; “[Web design is 95% typography](https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period), so it’s only logical to say that a web designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information.“

I always share something to watch, whether it’s an interesting talk, a short film or a tutorial I’ve lernt something from or found interesting. It tends to be a good way to wrap up the week and start the weekend.

Finally, if I have any of my own work to share I usually put this in at the end.

You can see [examples from the archive](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca) anytime.

If this sound good to you, leave your email below and join me every Friday morning. Rest assured that [your email will be kept safe](/privacy/) at all times.
