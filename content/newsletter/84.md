Hi Folks,

Here’s this weeks hoard of noteworthy links from around the internet...

## Thought provoking

“We focused too much on what we wanted to bring to the world...We needed to pay attention to what the world wanted from us.”

In [Design on a deadline: How Notion pulled itself back from the brink of failure](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-on-a-deadline-how-notion-pulled-itself-back-from-the-brink-of-failure/), Carmel DeAmicis talks to Ivan Zhao, founder of Notion, about how they turned round a struggling startup.

## Design and Code

## Typography

”For us, it’s about being inspired by things outside of the tight type design community. In the case of Movement, we turned to dance.”

[Movement](http://www.nmtype.com/movement/) is a free variable font created by [Noel Pretorius and María Ramos](http://www.nmtype.com/). The project began as a collaboration with Design Indaba and the contemporary dancer Andile Vellem. Madeleine Morley find out more about the project in [Typography Dancing Like It’s Never Danced Before, Thanks to Variable Font Technology](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/typography-dancing-like-its-never-danced-before-thanks-to-variable-font-technology/).
