Hi Folks,

As we near the end of the year, I’d like to wish you all a happy holiday and share a few things I'm excited about for 2018.

## In Detail v4

We’re making several changes to [In Detail](https://indtl.com/) over the next few months. [Luke](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/) and I are working hard on the design and functionality, moving the site forward and improving the reading experience for an ever growing audience. Type setting, spacing and layout are just [a few things on our roadmap](https://trello.com/b/eoBqFYoN/id-design-dev-roadmap).

[Beanie](https://www.instagram.com/beaniemajor/) and the team have been working no doubt harder on content, so expect even more impressive content surrounding the jewellery industry.

[London’s Royal Opera House – the jewels](https://indtl.com/interview/jewels-londons-royal-opera-house) is the latest interview if you haven't seen it already.

## Invision v7, Studion and DSM

[Invision v7](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/invision-v7) is a complete re-build of Invision app, which many of us are using day in day out as our main tool for software prototyping and collaboration. [V7](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/new-invision-v7/) promises to be 8x faster, support responsive design and integrate with two other new Invision products — [Design System Manager](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/announcing-invision-design-system-manager/) and [Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio). Sketch killer? I'll let you decide. Invision v7 is due to launch at the beginning of 2018.

## Type Services

I’ve had a slight hiatus from working on [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/), since starting 3 hrs/day of German lessons. However, next year I’ll be back to it and can promise a lot more type design. Gratis natürlich!

## Design principles

What’s design without principles?

“Design Principles are a set of considerations that form the basis of any good product.”

[Principles.Design](https://principles.design/) is an archive of 134 (and counting) examples of design principles, used by leading organisations, individuals and product teams to help guide decision making.

## How Stripe designs Beautiful Websites

Lee Robinson examines [the tips and tricks used to make Stripe’s website](http://Article: https://www.leejamesrobinson.com/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/) design a notch above the rest.

## Front End Checklist

[An extremely handy tool](https://frontendchecklist.io/) for building great sites which meet web standards. I wish I had access to this sooner. I'd also argue it's essential for all developers not just the meticulous ones. Here's [the Github source](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist) if you prefer.

## Laying out the future with Grid and Flexbox

It can be confusing knowing when to use CSS Grid vs CSS Flexbox.

[This talk by Rachel Andrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThzedI9MhcU) will help you understand the differences.

Whilst we’re here, I made [a dead simple mobile first flex grid system](https://codepen.io/harrycresswell/pen/MrYvmZ) drawing on ideas from [this article by Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/easiest-flex-grid-ever/) and [Solved by Flexbox](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/grids/).

## I’m a Fucking Webmaster

## For your ears

[&ME – The Rapture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQHmYjBgms). Nothing new but it's been in my ears this week. More repetitive Goodness.
