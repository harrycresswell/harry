Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #128, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

## Typography

“We also grew into this over time, from learning and doing graphic design, slowly shifting to type design, being fascinated with fonts being these very basic and functional things that still allow for so much personal and stylistic choice.” Fabian Harb and Johannes Breyer in [Dinamo: The No-boundary Foundry](https://fontstand.com/articles/dinamo)

Designer of Inter, [Rasmus Anderson shares his glyph design process](https://twitter.com/rsms/status/1223648753174757376?s=20) in a Twitter thread.
