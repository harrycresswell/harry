Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #146, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

”Going forward, we will have to decide how we want to prepare for the shifts ahead of us. Scenario planning suggests that you come up with a “robust strategy”. Robust in this case doesn’t mean “rigid” but instead being flexible, adaptable, and also “resilient” and therefore well-prepared for a range of possible outcomes.” Mattias Ott in [Welcome to the 21st Century](https://matthiasott.com/notes/welcome-to-the-21st-century).

“My students taught me that new experiences help us gain insight, that exploration results in joy, and that nothing needs to be perfect.” In [Design With Your Inner Child In Mind](https://dribbble.com/stories/2020/06/01/design-with-your-inner-child), Renee Fleck tells her story of suffering a setback and how she used what she learnt during her time as a preschool school teacher to bounce back.

## Design and Code

[Building the Woke Web: Web Accessibility, Inclusion & Social Justice](https://alistapart.com/article/building-the-woke-web/). What would your life be like without the internet?

## Typography

Google fonts has added three new font famililes; [DM Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono), a three weight, three style family designed for DeepMind. [Jost](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jost), a variable font inspired by 1920s German sans-serifs and [Balsamiq Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans) a handwritten font created for the Balsamiq Wireframes contains 942 glyphs in 2 weights with italics.

[Typographic Matchmaking](https://www.type-together.com/typographic-matchmaking). Veronika Burian and José Scaglione of Type Together share tips on pairing typefaces, “a difficult task that requires a balance of knowledge, eye experience, and boldness.”

[Text for Proofing Fonts: A farewell to The Quick Brown Fox](https://www.typography.com/blog/text-for-proofing-fonts). Jonathan Hoefler on why Hoefler&Co have ditched pangrams and rewritten proofs from scratch, trading their wacky and self-satisfied cleverness for lists of words that are actually illustrative.

“Civilité was invented for ideological reasons but failed owing to changing tastes, a mistimed typographical fashion statement, if you like. Civilité was elaborate and Gothic at a time when all-things Gothic were already in decline.” John Boardley in [Death of a typeface](https://ilovetypography.com/2020/06/06/robert-granjon-civilite-death-of-a-typeface/).
