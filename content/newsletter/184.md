Hey everyone,

Welcome to Issue #184. 

March was full of ups and downs, for me. Although [it started with Covid](https://harrycresswell.com/updates/growing-up/), I somehow still managed to get quite a bit done. Various client projects, [a new coat of paint for Local London](https://poly.work/harrycresswell/highlights/641a0951-843f-4580-9bcf-f447447445af), I also released [my first Hugo theme](https://github.com/harrycresswell/mood). 

Funny, because I sat down to write this issue thinking: “I haven’t done much this month...what the hell am I going to write about.” Goes to show how important it is to reflect on things.

Towards the end of the month we travelled to Germany for a family event, then stuck around for a week to catch up with old friends. I wasn’t very productive in that time, so I wrote about [slowing down](https://harrycresswell.com/updates/slowing-down/), and being ok with it. 

I just read about [Tom’s struggles with consistency](https://macwright.com/2022/03/29/recently.html) and how progress waxes and wanes. I totally relate. It’s always good to hear that you’re not the only one.

Anyway. Here are some links that caught my eye this month. And, one I wrote myself about moving my email away from Google.

## Thought provoking

“So much of our work is spent chasing trends and shiny objects instead of building simple, durable, useful tools that stick around for a while.” Chris Ferdinandi in [Building things to last](https://gomakethings.com/building-things-to-last/).

“It's not enough to learn what specific properties do. We need to learn how the layout algorithms work, and how they *use* the properties we provide to them.” Josh W. Comeau’s understanding of CSS is exceptional. [Understanding Layout Algorithms](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/) is a must read for anyone who works with CSS.

## Design and Code

[Website Themes and Color Schemes](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/themes-and-schemes/). Ryan Mulligan shares his journey building a website theme switching slider.

 Michelle Barker runs though some of the [New CSS Features In 2022](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/new-css-features-2022/), how they relate to intrinsic web design, and the challenges that lie in store for the future of the language.

I enjoyed reading Maya’s [Behind Gumroad’s New Design System](https://gumroad.com/blog/behind-gumroads-new-design-system). Gumroad’s approach to CSS, and decision to avoid classes where possible is super interesting. From what I can see, it’s also very effective. 

## Performance and sustainability

“If you inline CSS and generate HTML efficiently, their overhead is negligible compared to the network round-trip.” Taylor Hunt in [Making the world’s fastest website, and other mistakes](https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na).

[Optimising Largest Contentful Paint](https://csswizardry.com/2022/03/optimising-largest-contentful-paint/). Lots of useful tips in this one, from Harry Roberts.

[Are my third parties green?](https://aremythirdpartiesgreen.com/) A tool built by Fershad Irani, which check the third party resources used by a website for sustainable energy source.

## Privacy and security

[Secure, privacy focused email](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/privacy-focused-email/) documents my recent switch from using Google for email to Tutanota.

## Typography

[Hermes rebrands as Evri with 194,481 different logos](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/superunion-monotype-hermes-rebrand-graphic-design-180322). Using variable font intelligence, Monotype and Superunion have pulled off fascinatingly experimental type work for a major brand revamp.

[Variable fonts in real life: how to use and love them](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/variable-fonts-in-real-life-how-to-use-and-love-them). Interesting to learn about the disadvantages – pricing, software support, and file size.

## Something to watch

[Is HTML A Programming Language?](https://briefs.video/videos/is-html-a-programming-language) Heydon’s back with a new video to set the record straight.
