I was away from my desk for a good part of September. I took time off to travel to Germany for a friends birthday, followed by two weeks exploring the Croatian coastline and a few neighbouring islands. 

It felt great to get away, to see old friends, meet new people and discover new places. But I’m happy to be back to it, ready for a change in seasons and the colder weather that’s arrived here in London.

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Launched another English/German multilingual Hugo site, this time for my friend [Carlota’s Psychotherapy practice](https://psychotherapie-morgandiez.de/) in Hamburg.

Watched [Nine Serfect Strangers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8760932/), [Jack Whitehall: Fatherhood with My Father](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28756879/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_5_tt_2_nm_6_in_0_q_jack%2520white) and [Big Little Lies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3920596/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_in_0_q_big%2520little%2520).

Read [Imminent](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210963085-imminent) by Luis Elizondo, [Sekret Machines: Chasing Shadows](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28187226-chasing-shadows) by Tom Delonge and AJ Hartley.

After years of doing a really bad job at collection client testimonials, I finally started working on a [testimonials page](https://harrycresswell.com/testimonials/) for my website.

Spent memorable time in Hamburg, Split, Braç, Korčula and Dubrovnik.

Celebrated the marriage of my step sister with friends and family.


## Elsewhere on the web

[We're losing our digital history. Can the Internet Archive save it?](https://bbc.com/future/article/20240912-the-archivists-battling-to-save-the-internet). An interesting read on the fragility of content on the web, the challenges of maintaining it and whether a much of it is even worth saving.

In [Going Buildless](https://mxb.dev/blog/buildless/) Max Böck looks at the feasibility of building websites without build tools.

As many of you know I’ve been working on a Hugo course in my spare time, so I was interesting to read about Chris Ferdinandi’s process in [How to create a course](https://chrisferdinandi.com/guides/courses/).

[What Price?](https://adactio.com/journal/21405). Jeremy Keith highlights the lack of logic behind some of the typical justifications around the use of generative AI tools.

The [State of HTML 2024](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2024?source=announcement_email) Survey is now open.

## What I’m up to in October

- Reading and writing.
- Building a website for a recently rebranded solar company.
- Decorating the house.
- Celebrating Rebekka’s 30th birthday! 🍾
