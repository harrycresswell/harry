Hi folks,

Here are a few links I felt were worth sharing this week.

## Thought provoking

In [How to build a low-tech website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/), Low-tech Magazine share their process and reasons for building a website powered 100% by solar.

[The Most Important Skill Nobody Taught You](https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-most-important-skill-nobody-taught-you-9b162377ab77) from Nat Rana.

## Design and Code

[Harry Robert’s has as Skillshare class](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Modern-CSS-Writing-Better-Cleaner-More-Scalable-Code/771669373) on writing modern scaleable CSS with ITCSS.

[The complete guide to lazy loading images](https://css-tricks.com/the-complete-guide-to-lazy-loading-images/) by Rahul Nanwani.

[CSS Grid in 45mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCZdCKjnBCs&__s=uwd2vxtntrjw1peddbq1&utm_source=drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=CSS+Grid+in+45+Minutes%21+) from Wes Bos.

## Typography

I enjoyed reading [From idea to typeface: How are fonts designed?](https://underscoretype.com/2018/09/27/from-idea-to-typeface-how-are-fonts-designed/)

In the wild: Source Serif Pro as seen on [Mathew Ström’s personal site](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/designing-with-code.html).

## Something to watch

Recently I was lucky enough to see [Mariou State](https://mariboustate.co.uk/) play music in Lisbon. Here’s [Nervous Tics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbF4YoYvQqc) taken from their new album [Kingdom in Colour](https://mariboustate.lnk.to/kicYo).
