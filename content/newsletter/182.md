Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #182, I hope you’ve all had a positive start to 2022.

This month I’ve mainly been hammering away at my keyboard writing content for [my Hugo course](https://practicalhugo.com/). So far so good, but it might take me a while! Doing my best to write [daily updates](/updates/). I didn’t manage every day, but let’s be honest, that was always going to be difficult. 

I’m also [giving timeblocking another go](/updates/time-blocking/) in an attempt to structure my time better. It’s not always easy to stick to your blocks, but it’s a useful guide and a massive help for focus. 

Something else I’ve been working on is [using facades to load video ](/updates/facades/). I might write some more about this in the coming weeks as it’s a super simple way to improve site performance.

Anyway, enough about what I’ve been up to. Here’s your monthly dose of what’s happening in and around the world of design, code and typography.
