Here are my highlights from March, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month of April.

### Highlights from March

Watched [The Dropout](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10166622/), [Poor Things](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230458/), [The Gentlemen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13210838/) and [Beef](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14403178/).

Added a [links](https://harrycresswell.com/links/) page to my personal site and spent far too much time deliberating whether or not to make link titles link to the external content or to an internal page – I went with the latter.

Published [Software that encourages deletion](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/software-that-encourages-deletion/), [Digital clean up day](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/digital-clean-up-day/), [Finding good websites](https://harrycresswell.com/links/finding-good-websites/), [File over app](https://harrycresswell.com/links/file-over-app/) and [Ready to Party Like It’s 1999…Again](https://harrycresswell.com/links/party-like-its-1999/).

Read [The Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money) by Morgan Housel.

Spent a great week skiing in La Plagne with a bunch of friends.

### Elsewhere on the web

> “Reducing digital clutter is synonymous with prioritizing what truly matters.”

[Embracing simplicity: the indubitable benefits of reducing digital clutter](https://www.worldcleanupday.org/post/embracing-simplicity-the-indubitable-benefits-of-reducing-digital-clutter) from Iryna Komazova.

I recently discovered Jared White’s [The Internet Review](https://theinternet.review/) and enjoyed reading [Why I’m Ready to Party Like It’s 1999…Again](https://theinternet.review/2024/03/13/ready-to-party-like-its-1999/) about how blogging is making a comeback.

After writing about [Software that prioritises local data storage](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/software-that-encourages-deletion/#software-that-prioritises-local-data-storage), I fell down the *local-first software development* rabbit whole and spent a good bit of time reading [Local-first software: You own your data, in spite of the cloud](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/), a long but fascinating read.

[What the world needs](https://adactio.com/journal/20996). Jeremy Keith on why you should be writing and publishing on the web.

[606: Web Sustainability with Michelle Barker](https://shoptalkshow.com/606/). Chris, Dave and Michelle talk about the environmental impact of our websites and how to build the web in a more sustainable way.

### What I’m up to in April

- Various client projects.
- Rewriting the CSS on my personal website.
- Writing [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) content.
- Hosting friends and family from Germany in London.
- Parkrunning.
