[RSS is still the best](/feeds/) way to subscribe to this newsletter. However, for those who prefer email, things may look a little different as I’ve switched from Mailchimp to Brevo. I briefly explain the reasons for this switch over in [a recent now page entry](/now/25-08-05/).

That’s all I have to say right now. I’m sick with some kind of flu virus, so writing is a real effort (hence the delay in publishing).  Hopefully I’ll be back to it soon enough.

Here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead. 

## Highlights from last month

- Watched ET, The Truman Show, A Complete Unknown, Dead Poets Society,  The Bear and Alien Earth.
- Deleted content from my various X accounts. Some unfortunately I no longer have access to. 
- Started work on the final episode of Practical Hugo before launch.
- Celebrated my brothers birthday.

## Elsewhere on the web

[CSS-only scrollspy effect using scroll-marker-group and :target-current](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-scrollspy/) by Sara Soueidan.

Sara shares a cool technique, soon to hit browsers, which until now has required JavaScript to achieve.

[We are still the web](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/we-are-still-the-web/) by Jay Hoffman.

> “The web was created for participation, by its nature and by its design. It can’t be bottled up long. In 2005, blogging was the answer to the question of what comes next. I look to history, and I’ve been wrong about the future many times. But I do know that the audience will tell us what’s next this time too.”

Jay looks back at the history of the web, showing how it’s usually the people who dictate its direction. Great read.

[Building a slow web](https://goodinternetmagazine.com/building-a-slow-web/) by Greg Sarjeant.

I enjoyed reading about Greg’s delight in ditching feeds and finding a more manageable pace with the IndieWeb and his personal website. I definitely share his sentiment. 

[A notional design studio](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/a-notional-design-studio/) from Ethan Marcotte,

> ‘Design for this “national studio” is about surface-level signals of “experience” and “beauty,” instead of the messy, iterative, imperfect work involved in designing something for people.’

Ethan expertly analyses the American by Design initiative website and draws parallels between the site itself and the current state of American politics. 

[COP30 website review. Rinse and repeat](http://fershad.com/writing/cop30-website-review/) from Fershad Irani. 

Lots of great takeaways from Fershad’s performance and sustainability review of this years COP website. None more so than that it probably should have been a static website instead of an SPA.

[A good find](https://justinjackson.ca/good-find) from Justin Jackson.

> “Algorithms are deciding what you’ll like before you’ve even had a chance to explore. Let’s start giving ourselves the freedom to be curious, rather than being spoon-fed. Most of the fun of discovering something cool is the journey you took to get there.”

Right behind this call to spend more time mindfully seeking out good content. Adding a little friction, as Justin describes it.

[Brain Baking impact](https://brainbaking.com/impact/). An interesting project from Walter Groeneveld, which attempts to measure the impact of his blog, by mapping the location of those who have interacted with it.

Now a few relating to the AI bubble:

[GPT-5: Overdue, overhyped and underwhelming. And that’s not the worst of it](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/gpt-5-overdue-overhyped-and-underwhelming) from Gary Marcus.

Seems like we’re not missing out on much.

[I Am An AI Hater](https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html). 

> “I am here to be rude, because this is a rude technology, and it deserves a rude response.”

A brilliant piece, which I’m sure you may have already seen doing the rounds. 

[This website is for humans](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-website-is-for-humans/) from Sophie Koonin.

> “Generative AI is a blender chewing up other people’s hard work, outputting a sad mush that kind of resembles what you’re looking for, but without any of the credibility or soul.”

## What I’m up to in September

- Working on a few client commitments.
- Working on Practical Hugo and ERYN.
- Running the Athens half marathon.
- Taking some time off for holiday.
