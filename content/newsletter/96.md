Hey everyone,

Here’s this weeks roundup of what’s new in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

We all share and use the web, just as we all share and live on this planet. [The Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/) is a public declaration of a shared commitment to create a sustainable internet.

[The first draft of anything is shit](https://www.writingroutines.com/the-first-draft-of-anything-is-shit/) from Writing Routines.

## Design and Code

[Daily Ethical Design](https://alistapart.com/article/daily-ethical-design/). Lennart Overkamp on what it means to design ethically and how to practice it daily to elevate your standard of design.

[The CSS Mindset](https://mxb.dev/blog/the-css-mindset/) from Max Böck.

[Learn git concepts, not commands](https://dev.to/unseenwizzard/learn-git-concepts-not-commands-4gjc). An interactive git tutorial by Nico Riedmann, meant to teach you how git works, not just which commands to execute.

[Mercury OS](https://uxdesign.cc/introducing-mercury-os-f4de45a04289). A speculative vision of the operating system by Jason Yuan, driven by humane design principles.

## Typography

[Apple introduces New York font, an all-new serif](https://thedesignest.net/apple-introduces-new-york-font-an-all-new-serif/). The new typeface is "designed to work on its own as well as alongside San Francisco," the system font for iOS, macOS, and tvOS since 2014.

## Something to watch
