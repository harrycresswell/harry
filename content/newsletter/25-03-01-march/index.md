We’re having the most incredible spell of winter sun here in London right now. It’s a welcome change from the cold gloomy weather we’ve had until now. 

Builders have been in all week re-plastering our kitchen, so it’s been a bit of a mad house. But today it’s peaceful and still. R is out on a pastry course all day, so I’m making the most of the quiet. Catching a few rays as they stream through the window and I laze about on the sofa.  

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Watched [Irresistible: why we can’t stop eating](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0025gqs), [Solar System](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33679603/) and [Words on Bathroom Walls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8045906/)

Published [Semantic headings on list pages](/writing/semantic-headings-on-list-pages/), [Planning meals](/writing/planning-meals/), [Generate pages from Google Sheets using Hugo’s Content Adapters](/writing/generate-pages-from-google-sheets/), [Silence and action](/writing/silence-and-action/)

Read [The Duolingo Handbook](https://blog.duolingo.com/handbook/) and [Far Journeys by Robert Monroe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347905.Far_Journeys).

Made the trip to Snozone in Milton Keynes with my brother. A little warm up before our trip to the Alps next week.

Managed my first Parkrun of the year.

Released cu [v.0.1.8](https://cu.harrycresswell.com/changelog/25-02-17-v0.1.8/).

## Elsewhere on the web

[Why I Like Designing in the Browser](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/why-i-like-designing-in-the-browser/). Tyler Sticka shares a bunch of good reasons why it makes sense to spend more in-browser design time and when he prefers to opt for a design app.

I enjoyed reading Tomasz Jakut’s [Taking RWD To The Extreme](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2025/02/taking-rwd-to-the-extreme/), about the evolution of web design from imperative design (telling the browser “how”) to declarative design (telling the browser “what”).

[Building a progress-indicating scroll-to-top button in HTML and CSS](https://matuzo.at/blog/2025/scroll-to-top-button). A great way to use scroll-driven animations and progressive enhancement from Manuel Matuzović.

[Skip links: what, why, and how](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/skip-links-what-why-and-how). A great primer from Martin Underhill on a must-have feature of an accessible, well-designed website.

[100 Days of Web Experiments: A Designer’s Journey into the Unknown](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/02/24/100-days-of-web-experiments-a-designers-journey-into-the-unknown/). Suz Sirunyan on breaking out of the comfort  zone and finding creativity again through exploration.

[In praise of off-screen menus](https://piccalil.li/blog/in-praise-of-off-screen-menus/). Jason Bradberry makes a really good case for using off-screen menus, instead of slamming them like we usually do.

## What I’m up to in March

Working on various client commitments.

Writing a post about generating Markdown files from Airtable data for Obsidian.

Taking a week off to go skiing with a bunch of friends in the French Alps. I cannot wait! 

Working on personal projects: [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) and [cu.css](https://cu.harrycresswell.com/).
