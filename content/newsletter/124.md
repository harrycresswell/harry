Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #124, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## News (from me)

I just published my [intentions for 2020](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/intentions-2020/). They’re fairly rough but should give you an idea of how I wish to spend my time and energy over the course of this year.

## Thought provoking

“It is easy to feel like a minimalist when you can order food, summon a car or rent a room using a single brick of steel and silicon. But in reality, it is the opposite. We are taking advantage of a maximalist assemblage. Just because something looks simple does not mean it is; the aesthetics of simplicity cloak artifice, or even unsustainable excess.”
