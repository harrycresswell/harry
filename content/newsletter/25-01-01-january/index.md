Happy New Year and welcome to the first newsletter of 2025!

Turns out Hilly Fields is a great spot to see in the new year. With an almost 360º view over the city, we managed to catch the best of the fireworks as they were going off across London. There must have been close to a thousand of us up there. Waving sparklers, battling the wind and dodging the odd stray rocket. Great fun and completely free.  

Anyway, I trust you’ve had a good one and managed to find some time to relax over the holidays. 

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Watched [Black Doves](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27995113/), [Skeleton Crew](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20600980/), [Gladiator II](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9218128/), [Anatomy of a Fall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17009710/) and [Kinds of Kindness](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22408160/).

Spent time with family in Hamburg. Highlights include [Miniatur Wunderland](https://www.miniatur-wunderland.de/), a day trip to Lüneburg. Fantastic meals at [Edmundo’s](https://bigsquadra.com/restaurants/edmondo-hamburg/), [Morgenmuffel](https://www.instagram.com/morgenmuffelhamburg/) and, of course, the Christmas markets.

Published [2024 in review](/writing/2024-review/), [Modern work fucking sucks](/links/modern-work-fucking-sucks/) and [Ethical Web Principles](/links/ethical-web-principles/).

Attended a couple of Christmas parties. One with the team at AIN and one with a few of my fellow freelance friends who don’t get the typical office party.

Celebrated Christmas with family in London.

## Elsewhere on the web

> “A single line of CSS can enable slick multi-page transitions for web applications (and web sites for those who maintain there's a difference), opening up new possibilities for web app architectures, and website experiences.”

## What I’m up to in January

Generating landing pages from remote data sources using [Hugo’s Content Adapters](https://gohugo.io/content-management/content-adapters/) feature. Hopefully I’ll also be writing about how to do it.

Picking up we we left off with various client commitments.
