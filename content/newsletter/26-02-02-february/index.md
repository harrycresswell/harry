A good mix of travel, exercise, learning new things, great conversations and completing our kitchen renovation seems to have got me through the first month of 2026. All in all it wasn’t too bad. 

As for the next 11 months, there’s a fair bit I’d like to get done. Particularly from a work perspective, like better positioning my business offering and finding some new clients. I have a rough plan of action. And, I’m hoping with a little direction and focus, I might make some headway.


As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Went [tobogganing on the Hirscheckblitz Rodelbahn](https://harrycresswell.com/now/26-01-01/), followed by [Berchtesgaden Advent](https://www.berchtesgadener-advent.de/en/home-en/), then dinner at Goldener Bär. Great start to the new year.

Published [Inserting products into posts](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/inserting-products-into-posts/) and [The config directory](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/config-directory/).

Migrated the Practical Hugo newsletter from [Buttondown to Brevo](https://practicalhugo.com/changelog/2026/01/29/buttondown-to-brevo/).

Spun up a Hetzner server and figured out how to deploy Hugo sites on Coolify. Only took me a full day messing around with Nixpacks and Dockerfiles!  I’ll try to write about how this works this soon.

Bought an angle grinder and finally got round to [tiling our kitchen](https://harrycresswell.com/now/26-01-19/#away-from-my-desk).

Started watching [Spielberg’s 2002 mini-series Taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TU3YHbVIZs).

## Elsewhere on the web

[A website to destroy all websites: How to win the war for the soul of the internet and build the web we want](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/) from Henry Desroches.

> “...the path back to feeling like you have some control is to un-spin yourself from the Five Apps of the Apocalypse and reclaim the Internet as a set of tools you use to build something you can own & be proud of.”

A wonderful essay, beautifully presented, exploring how the technology we create and use enables us at first, then extracts value from us and finally exclude us from society, unless we use it. The final part proposes a practical solution to the problem.

[The Case for Blogging in the Ruins](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-case-for-blogging-in-the-ruins/) from Joan Westenberg.

> ”...owning your own platform is a form of independence that becomes more important as centralized platforms become less trustworthy.

Can’t get enough of Joan’s writing!

[It’s hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/) from Nikita Prokopov . 

Nikita explains why Apple’s decision to add unpleasant, distracting, illegible, messy, cluttered, confusing, frustrating icons to every menu item was a terrible idea.

[How to Increase Your Luck Surface Area](https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area) from Jason Roberts.

Earlier this week, [Dave](https://davesmyth.com/) and I were discussing the idea of expanding your network by putting work out there. Later I recalled Jason’s post about luck surface area. Aaron expands on Jason’s idea in [Publishing your work increases your luck](https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work/). In a similar vein, [A guide to working in public](https://danmall.com/posts/a-guide-to-working-in-public/) from Dan Mall and [Learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) from Shawn Wang are also worth reading.

[Understanding the fundamentals of CSS Layout](https://polypane.app/blog/understanding-the-fundamentals-of-css-layout/) from Kilian Valkhof.

CSS’s main layout algorithms, flow, positioning, flexbox and grid, brilliantly explained.

[Why So Many Info Tips Are Bad (and How to Make Them Better)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/info-tips-bad/) from Kate Kaplan.

Practical advice on how to work with an easily forgotten UI pattern. 

## What I’m up to in February

- Heading to the Stubai Valley in Tyrol, Austria, for a week of skiing.
- Attending [CloudCannon’s next Partner Sync on Web Performance](https://community.cloudcannon.com/t/partner-sync-lets-talk-about-web-performance/394).
- Starting training for [the next half-marathon](https://www.hackneymoves.com/).
- Launching the first season of [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) (if all goes to plan)
