Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week

## Understanding Serverless

[What the heck is serverless?](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/162-what-the-heck-is-serverless/) Chris Coyier and David Wells from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) talk Serverless and why it matters.

In [First Steps with Serverless](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/163-first-steps-with-serverless/) they take a look at cloud functions and build a prototype.

## Design and CSS

[10 small design mistakes we still make](https://uxplanet.org/10-small-design-mistakes-we-still-make-1cd5f60bc708). Eugen Eşanu shares lessons learned from the popular Web Usability book [Don’t Make Me Think](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited) by Steve Krug.

[CSS Grid Level 2: Here Comes Subgrid](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/css-grid-2/). Rachel Andrew explains the new featured of Grid.

## Typography and tools

[Rob Weychert takeaways from Ampersand 2018](http://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/06/ampersand/), a day of talks on the future of typography.

[Type Playbook](https://www.process-masterclass.com/typeplaybook-heydesigner/): a free ebook of core typefaces and type principles complied and used by Nguyen Le.

[Unique](https://unique.prototypo.io/): an interesting project from [Prototypo the variable type design tool](https://www.prototypo.io/), which helps you build a custom font by choosing parameters.

## Something to watch

[Jim Carrey: I Needed Color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21CEOlBq2YI). A short documentary on the fascinating side of Jim Carrey you may not know about. Props to [Ed](https://twitter.com/Ed_Stephens_1) for sending this one my way.
