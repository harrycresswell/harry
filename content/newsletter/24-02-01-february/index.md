That one went by fast, but I packed quite a bit into it. Not quite the gentle *ease into the new year* I was hoping for, but when is it ever.

Here are my highlights from January, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month of February.

## Highlights from January

- Watched [Studio 54](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001tvnj/studio-54), [You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oygkWmXyOaM), a bunch of Masterchef and a few episodes of The X-Files Season 2.
- Read [The warm dry home](https://shop.heritage-house.org/product/book-the-warm-dry-home/) by Pete Ward.
- Published [Introducing cu.css](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/introducing-cu-css/) and [OKR in Obsidian](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/okr-in-obsidian/).
- Released a bunch of cu.css updates ([v0.1.1 - v0.1.4](https://github.com/harrycresswell/cu/releases)).
- Went to see the [Accidentally Wes Anderson](https://awaexhibition.com/london/) exhibition.
- Ran my second [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/).
- Spent time with my sister and nephew – we almost solved the Rubix cube.
- Decorated the spare room and fixed up our rotting window sills.


## Elsewhere on the web

- [Displaying Series of Posts in Hugo](https://brainbaking.com/post/2024/01/displaying-series-of-posts-in-hugo/). A good example of using [Hugo’s complement function](https://gohugo.io/functions/collections/complement/) from Wouter Groeneveld. 
- I also enjoyed reading Wouter’s [Publish your work](https://brainbaking.com/post/2024/01/publish-your-work/), it reminded me that I need to write more about the things I’m working on.
- [A Practical Introduction to Scroll-Driven Animations with CSS scroll() and view()](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2024/01/17/a-practical-introduction-to-scroll-driven-animations-with-css-scroll-and-view/) from Adam Argyle. The idea of being able to do this kind of stuff without JavaScript is magical.
- [My AI Dad](https://brandonwrites.xyz/my-ai-dad/) from Brandon helped me realise that AI isn’t all bad and at times can even offer guidance and support.
- After reading [Linking](https://adactio.com/journal/20811) from Jeremy Keith and [Links page update](https://brandonwrites.xyz/links-page-update/) from Brandon, it’s clearly time for a links page.

## What I’m up to in February

- More [cu.css](https://cu.harrycresswell.com/) updates.
- Continuing with [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) content.
- Client work: Completing Buxton migration. Various Mew and AIN projects.
