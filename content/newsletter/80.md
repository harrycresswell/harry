Hi Folks,

Here’s this weeks hoard of noteworthy links from around the internet...

## Thought provoking

Jeremy Wagner on why it’s important to [Make it boring](https://jeremy.codes/blog/make-it-boring/).

[Designing for Friction and Flow in Customer Journeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FerGgh5cSQ) a short but helpful video from Maria Rosala, with some clever analogies.

## Design and Code

“Color lets digital tools speak to you on a subconscious level, more immediate and intimate than words or iconography.” Ben Hersh on [The Mystery of Color](https://medium.com/s/story/the-mystery-of-color-e45ab2faa6a4).

A recent Twitter thread got Michelle Barker thinking about how people interpret the use cases for [CSS Grid Layout versus Flexbox](https://css-irl.info/to-grid-or-to-flex/).

Bradley Taunt provides a practical approach to [Easy custom radio inputs](https://accssible.com/2019/01/21/easy-custom-radio-inputs/).

[JAMstack WTF](https://jamstack.wtf/) A simple guide by Pedro Duarte to help explain how JavaScript, API’s and Markdown is revolutionising the way we think about the development workflow.

## Typography

“Learning more about how fonts work can open new doors in how you work and what you create.” [Intro to Font Metrics](http://westonthayer.com/writing/intro-to-font-metrics/) by Weston Thayer.

“[Proto Grotesk](http://fontreviewjournal.com/proto-grotesk/) oozes with personality, combining some very old-school grotesque characteristics with a quirky, modern sensibility to create something that feels brand-spanking new.” Another great review from Bethany Heck.

## For your ears
