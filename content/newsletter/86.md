Hi Folks,

Here’s this weeks hoard of interesting links from around the internet...

## Thought provoking

“As designers, we need to see ourselves as gatekeepers of what we are bringing into the world, and what we choose not to bring into the world. Design is a craft with responsibility. The responsibility to help create a better world for all.”
