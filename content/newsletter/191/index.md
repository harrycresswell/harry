Hi everyone,

Welcome to issue #191. 

Here are a few things that caught my eye through October.

## Thought provoking

“You don’t have to like your work for it to work. Liking or not liking it isn’t the essential part of making something.” Mattaias Ott in [None of your business](https://matthiasott.com/notes/none-of-your-business).

[Google Fonts illegal in EU](https://www.usecue.com/blog/google-fonts-illegal-in-eu/). The instructions for using Google Fonts tell you to do something that is clearly illegal in the EU.

## Design and Code

“…all that you need to be a front end developer is HTML. That’s the foundation.” Chris Ferdinandi in [Congrats, you're a front end developer!](https://gomakethings.com/congrats-youre-a-front-end-developer/)

“Creeping featurism can kill your product and the morale of your team. Avoid it like the plague!” Brad Taunt on [Avoiding Featurism](https://tdarb.org/blog/avoid-featurism.html). 

“A browser-level control to indicate the “fidelity” of the experience you want, e.g. how much bandwidth, CPU, and battery are required to load and interact with the page“ Jim Nielsen in [Website Fidelity](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/website-fidelity/).

[The Component Gallery](https://component.gallery/). A collection of interface components from real-world design systems put together and beautifully illustrated by Iain Bean. Because most patterns already exist, and naming things is hard. So why try and reinvent the wheel?

## Typography

[Typographic hierarchies](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/10/typographic-hierarchies/). Alma Hoffmann discusses six basic variables to establish an effective typographic hierarchy.

Brecht De Ruyte on [Easy Fluid Typography With clamp() Using Sass Functions](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/10/fluid-typography-clamp-sass-functions/).

## Performance and sustainability

[COP27 Egypt: A webpage sustainability review](https://www.fershad.com/writing/cop27-egypt-a-webpage-sustainability-review/). Following the success of last years audit, Fershad Irani unpacks this year’s COP homepage, providing insight into ways it might be improved.

[Sustainable Web Development Strategies Within An Organization](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/10/sustainable-web-development-strategies-organization/). Michelle Barker explores some of the ways we can raise awareness and effect change within an organization to create a more positive environmental impact.

## Privacy and security

[Understanding Privacy](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/10/understanding-privacy-book-release/). A new book from Smashing Magazine all about how to create inclusive, safe and privacy-aware digital experiences.

[Cusdis](https://cusdis.com) is an open-source, lightweight (~5kb gzipped), privacy-first comment system.

## Something to watch

[CSS *is* awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo3px1L3H70). An amusing talk from Anton Gunnarsson at Nordic.js 2022, about the insanely cool things you can now do using a few lines of CSS.
