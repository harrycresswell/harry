These past few weeks I’ve been busy with client work. And doing behind the scenes stuff, like setting up a self-hosted image processing service to replace Cloudinary in my workflow (more on that soon).

I’m making progress, albeit slowly. But I guess that’s to be expected when you’re working on multiple projects and you’re learning new things. This shift in priorities has also meant that, unfortunately, I haven’t had much time to write. But I know I will soon enough. On several occasions I’ve had to remind myself that things worth doing take time and patience.

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Published [Animating native Lazy Loading (as a progressive enhancement)](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/animating-native-lazy-loading-progressive-enhancement/).

Watched [The Last of Us](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/), [The Chosen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5622316/), [Salmon fishing in the Yemen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441952/), [The Age of Adaline](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655441/).

Watched Chelsea qualify for the Champions League and win the Europa Conference League cup.

Celebrated R’s aunt and uncles 50th wedding anniversary in Kappeln and dad’s birthday in London.

Went to [Gala Festival](https://thisisgala.co.uk/) with a bunch of friends and saw Floating Points. 

## Elsewhere on the web

[The future must include all of us, even Figma](https://terminal.ahumanfuture.co/posts/2025-05-12/this-future-must-include-us-all-even-figma/). A fantastic piece about the irresponsible actions of Figma, with the launch of their latest offering; Figma Sites.

Josh W. Comeau’s [The Post-Developer Era](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-post-developer-era/) will dispel any concerns you may have about AI taking your job.

In [Are 'CSS Carousels' accessible?](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-carousels-accessibility/), Sara Soueidan examines the newly announced “CSS Carousels” through the lens of usability and accessibility and shares her findings.

I’ve long been a fan of Dave Smyth’s work, in particular [his approach to transparency](https://davesmyth.com/inspiration). Here Dave shares his objectives and findings, when taking his [Studio redesign](https://davesmyth.com/studio-redesign)

Jen Simmons shares some simple but effective tips for [Polishing your typography with line height units](https://webkit.org/blog/16831/line-height-units/ "Permanent Link: Polishing your typography with line height units"). 

As I mentioned last month, Andy and the team at Set Studio have started their first open working project, where they share the entire process behind their [Course Brand Development](https://piccalil.li/projects/course-brand-development/) project.

I enjoyed reading Manu’s post [On browsers, AI and the web](https://manuelmoreale.com/on-browsers-ai-and-the-web). He makes some great points. I particularly like this one about how chat-based AI tools are removing serendipity and the visual joys of browsing the web:

> “But more importantly, there’s something else about this whole idea of chatting-with-a-computer-to-get-answers-from-the-web that I find incredibly off-putting: the complete lack of potential for serendipity. Clicking on links and landing on random sites has the potential to take me in unexpected directions. And also the web is filled with creative people who have incredibly interesting sites from a visual point of view. All that is absent in a chat-based world and that’s something I just can’t personally accept for myself. Feels like such a boring way to browse the web.” 

[The future of web development is AI. Get on or get left behind.](https://alex.party/posts/2025-05-05-the-future-of-web-development-is-ai-get-on-or-get-left-behind). A very good point, very well made by Alex Riviere.

## What I’m up to in June

- Working on Practical Hugo and Eryn.
- Celebrating my birthday!
