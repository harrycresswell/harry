Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week

## 2 Compelling Case Studies

[The Making of Carrd](https://themakingof.carrd.co/), AJ documents his experience building [Carrd.co](https://carrd.co/)

A [UX case study of Booking.com](https://heydesigner.com/blog/booking-com-ux-case-study/) from Filippo Rovelli

## On design systems, UX and UI

In [Create your design system, part 1: Typography](https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-1-typography-7c630d9092bd) Sebastiano Guerriero shares how his team built a flexible type system using CSS variables.

In the second part; [Create your design system, part 2: Grid & Layout](https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-2-grid-layout-aa961d59b8d6), Claudia Romano details how they structured their content with CSS Grid and Flexbox

Get your design terms down with Figma’s [Dictionary](https://www.figma.com/dictionary/)

I just picked up the full [Streamline 3.0](https://streamlineicons.com/) icons set. Honestly the work that has gone into this is phenomenal. Money well spent.

## On Typography

Font in the wild: [Graphik from Commercial Type](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik/graphik/regular), seen here on [Hayk An’s personal site](http://hihayk.com/%23/%20)

I’m half way through Tim Brown’s new book [Flexible Typesetting](https://abookapart.com/products/flexible-typesetting). It’s packed full of useful tips and resources, I highly recommend picking up a copy.

Here’s the [Minuscule specimen](http://www.256tm.com/downloads/MINUSCULE_SPECIMEN.pdf), a typeface design by [256](http://www.256tm.com/) for use at extremely small sizes, under the commonly acknowledged threshold of legibility (around 7 points).

## Other notable mentions

[Refresh – a fresher approach to the web browser.](https://refresh.study/) Awesome concept project from Julius Sohn and Julius Gehrig. It was created at HTW Berlin as part of their bachelor thesis.
