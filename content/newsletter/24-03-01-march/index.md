Here are my highlights from February, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month of March.

### Highlights from February

Watched [Darkest Hour](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555426/), [Maestro](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5535276/), [Einstein and the Bomb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28756876/) and [One Day](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16283804/)

Read [Journeys out of the body](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347918.Journeys_Out_of_the_Body) by Robert Monroe and [Zen: The Art of Simple Living](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41081321-zen) by Shunmyō Masunoe.

Published [Adding a “last updated” date to posts](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/adding-a-last-updated-date-to-posts/) which might be useful for Hugo users.

Released cu.css [v0.1.5](https://cu.harrycresswell.com/changelog/24-02-14-v0.1.5/) which adds Prose and Switcher to the docs and includes various other small improvements to the documentation and CSS starter itself.

Ran a personal best at Parkrun.

### Elsewhere on the web

I enjoyed reading [Meandering Thoughts on Low Technology](https://downgrade.timrodenbroeker.de/posts/low-technology/) from Tim Rodenbröker. 

[Robins new homepage](https://robinrendle.com/notes/mini-manifesto/) inspired by HyperCard and the current state of the web is fantastic.

Ross Wintle’s [A manifesto for small, static, web apps](https://rosswintle.uk/2024/02/a-manifesto-for-small-static-web-apps/) really resonates, particularly after reading Michelle’s post above.

Lot’s on utility-first CSS doing the rounds this month. I particularly enjoyed Heydon’s [What is utility-first CSS?](https://heydonworks.com/article/what-is-utility-first-css/) which is as amusing as it is spot on. Also [Tailwind marketing and misinformation engine](https://nuejs.org/blog/tailwind-misinformation-engine/) from Tero Piirainen, which makes an excellent case for why we should avoid utility-first CSS. Full disclosure: I work on projects that use Tailwind, but I agree with everything said in these posts. That’s why I’m using Andy’s [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) in my personal projects.

[How to make external links accessible](https://blog.pope.tech/2024/01/02/how-to-make-external-links-accessible/) from Whitney Lewis makes a great case for why external links should open in the same tab.

I’m really enjoying Matthias Ott’s [Own Your Web](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb) newsletter. The latest issue, [Issue 10: Links Worth Sharing](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/archive/issue-10/) made me realise I need a /links pages.


### What I’m up to in March

- Taking a week off to go skiing in France with a bunch of friends.
- Finding a new book to read.
- Adding a /links page to my personal site.
- Various client projects.
- Writing [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) content.
- Parkrunning.
