Hey everyone,

Towards the end of last year I spent time travelling and focusing on other things, so it‘s been a few months since I sent one of these. 

Now I’m back to it, I thought I’d return to this newsletter by making [a few changes](/writing/more-newsletter-changes/) – a new format and a slightly different schedule.

I hope this will encourage me to share more about what I’m up to and what I’m currently working on. I’ll continue to share posts from others in the section called “Elsewhere on the web”. 

If this no longer appeals, then you’re welcome to [unsubscribe](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=d6ad2b65ca), at any time.
