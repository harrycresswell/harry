Packed a fair bit into the first four and a half weeks of two thousand and twenty five. 

Discovered a new climbing gym, celebrated friend’s birthdays, had some great conversations and made real progress with various work projects.

Perhaps I over did it slightly. I’m sat here now with the annual cold. But hey, at least the sun is finally shining. These crisp, bright winter mornings make all the difference. 

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Watched [SAS Rogue Heroes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10405370/) season 2, [Nobody wants this](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26933824/), [Nr. 24](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23782584/), [Official Secrets](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5431890/) and [Little Fires Everywhere](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8089592/).

Read [A History of Britain in 10 Enemies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203778046-a-history-of-britain-in-ten-enemies) by Terry Deary and [SAS: Rogue Heroes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29917179-sas) by Ben Macintyre.

Built a site for [Studio Mailo](https://studiomailo.com/), my fourth German language website. Designed by [Rebekka](https://rebekkawrites.com/), illustrated by me.

Worked on a client project to dynamically generate pages from Google Sheets data, using Hugo’s [Content Adapters](https://gohugo.io/content-management/content-adapters/). More on this soon.

Published [Running in the elements](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/running-in-the-elements/), [Blog questions challenge](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/blog-questions-challenge/), [Sunday meal prep](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/sunday-meal-prep/) and [the evolution of /now pages](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/evolution-of-now-pages/).

Bouldering with the Irregular Climbing Club.

## Elsewhere on the web

[Build for the Web, Build on the Web, Build with the Web](https://csswizardry.com/2025/01/build-for-the-web-build-on-the-web-build-with-the-web/). 

> “If I was only able to give one bit of advice to any company: **iterate quickly on a slow-moving platform**.
> 
> Every layer of abstraction made in the browser moves you further from the platform, ties you further into framework lock-in, and moves you further away from fast.”

A must read, from Harry Roberts, about why frameworks aren’t always the answer. Often you’ll create fewer headaches for yourself if you focus your efforts on the core web technologies and embrace progressive enhancement.

[The Free Web](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-free-web/) by Jay Hoffman.

> “...put something on the open web, free from the major platforms competing for our attention. And then, after that comes the real trick. Don’t ask for anything back. Let it be free. Libre _and_ gratis. Help bring the web back.”

The open web is the result of collective effort by millions of people making regular contributions. It will only die if we stop contributing.

[AI isn’t going to replace you](https://justinjackson.ca/ai-replace) from Justin Jackson.

> “If you're worried about AI taking your job, the answer is to focus on expertise, craftsmanship, and creativity.”

I totally agree with Justin on this one; AI is a tool for augmenting skilled people.

[Unplatform - Escape social media and join the IndieWeb](https://unplatform.fromthesuperhighway.com/) 

 These days, the extent of my social media use is posting my runs on Strava, but nonetheless, I’m enjoying reading Ajazz’s guide for escaping social media and joining the indie web.

[How to show snippets of content only on certain dates in Hugo SSG](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-show-snippets-of-content-only-on-certain-dates-in-hugo-ssg/). 

Chris Ferdinandi does some really creative stuff with Hugo. This piece on creating time-sensitive content is definitely worth a read.

[My approach to running a link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/) from Simon Willison. 

If you’re stuck for what to blog about, then read this post. Simon breaks down exactly how he goes about creating low stakes but high value content and always tries to add something extra. Fantastic stuff. 


## What I’m up to in February

Working on various client projects.

Writing a post about working with Content Adapters.

Working on personal projects: [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) and [cu.css](https://cu.harrycresswell.com/).

Improving my /now page and generally cleaning up my personal site.

Skiing in Milton Keynes with my brother.
