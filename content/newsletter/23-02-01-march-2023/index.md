Hey everyone,

I hope you’re doing well.

The past month has really flown by, but I suppose February always does! I’m deep into a client project at the moment, so it’s only a short one this month.


## ✨ Highlights from last month

- Watched [Stutz](https://youtu.be/UKCmefQdplI), [Clarkson’s Farm 2](https://youtu.be/-8txnuQRjWo) and [Bridge of Spies](https://youtu.be/mBBuzHrZBro).
- Published [Feedbin > NetNewsWire](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/feedbin-to-netnewswire/), [Safer Internet Day](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/safer-internet-day/), [Sleep on it](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/sleep-on-it/).
- Spun up an instance of [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is/) for personal projects.
- Saw the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra perform Rachmaninov’s Second Symphony at Cadogan Hall.
- Redesigned the content area of Practical Hugo, but I still need to build it.
- Settled on a name for the micro agency I’m working on with Rebekka (more on that soon).
