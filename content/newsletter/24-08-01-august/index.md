It feels like everything has finally slowed down for summer, which I’m enjoying a great deal. I like this pace a lot. It’s great to be sitting here working in a t-shirt, shorts and with bare feet again.

Anyway, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

### Highlights from last month

Watched [Challengers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16426418/), [UFO](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6290798/), [Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3083016) and [The Bear Season 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/episodes/?season=3).

I’ve been listening to [Three](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpGr7x_-mTQeEriEDckEWtzwkSOXYRtNA), the new album from Four Tet, which I discovered via Austin Kleon’s newsletter.

Read [Reality is Not What it Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29767627-reality-is-not-what-it-seems) by Carlo Rovelli.

Went to Warwickshire for a few days to celebrate the birthday of my mum and uncle.

Celebrated the wedding of two close friends in Dorset. It was a bit of a washout, and I took the full force while on carpark duty, but we still had a fantastic time.

[It’s about time I tried to explain what progressive enhancement actually is](https://piccalil.li/blog/its-about-time-i-tried-to-explain-what-progressive-enhancement-actually-is/). Excellent primer on progressive enhancement from Andy Bell. Start with HTML, 

[Learn Great Copywriting in 76 Minutes](https://youtu.be/TUMjnmfsPeM?si=pYKZm0Q9WdcaSUUO). Learnt a load from this one! David Perell and Harry Dry of Marketing Examples discuss the most important principles of compelling copywriting.

It happened. Sara Joy turned Baz Luhrmann’s Everybody's Free To Wear Sunscreen into [Everybody's Free (To Write Websites)](https://sarajoy.dev/blog/write-websites/), Keenan made an audio version, then Robb Knight made a cool video for it. Gotta love the indie web.

[Replacing gsap with scroll animations](https://dominickjay.com/writing/replace-gsap-wth-scroll-animations/). Dominick Jay demonstrates how to save a bunch of JavaScript by converting a GSAP animation to native CSS scroll animations. 

### What I’m up to this month

- Designing and building a website for a bespoke cabinet makers.
- Reading The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafón.
- Enjoying the good weather.
