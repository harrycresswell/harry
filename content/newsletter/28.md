Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Design Systems Handbook

“A design system unites product teams around a common visual language. It reduces design debt, accelerates the design process, and builds bridges between teams working in concert to bring products to life.”

[Design Systems Handbook](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook) is the latest guide from [DesignBetter.Co](https://www.designbetter.co/).

For more on design systems, Invision have complied [a list of design systems from the world's leading brand](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/design-systems/).

## Using Git in a team

[Using Git in a team: a cheatsheet](http://jameschambers.co/writing/git-team-workflow-cheatsheet/) by [James Chambers](https://twitter.com/jameschambers) saved my skin this week. I’ve been working on the [AIN UI kit](https://www.ainlabs.com/) which presented a rare opportunity to collaborate with another designer. This meant improving my solo Git workflow so I can handle the scary stuff like [feature branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) and [pull requests](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request). If you have a basic understanding of Git and want to take it up a gear you will find this article helpful.

## Remembering what you read

[How to remember what you read](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/10/how-to-remember-what-you-read/) takes a look at passive versus active reading.

“For us to get the most out of each book we read, it is vital to have a plan for recording, reflecting on, and putting into use the conclusions we draw from the information we consume”, writes [Shane Parrish](https://twitter.com/farnamstreet).

There’s a ton of bad advice on reading techniques out there but this article has some very useful tips if you are big on reading.

## Notes on Type Design and Klim

[Notes on Type Design](https://goo.gl/gRaRFz) (although it looks a relic from the 90's) is well worth reading. I actually discovered it via [an interview with Kris Sowersby](https://medium.com/type-thursday/its-harder-to-take-away-than-to-add-71669b2e5aee) who runs [Klim Type Foundry](https://klim.co.nz/) and perhaps best known for [Tiempos](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-headline/), a face influenced by type heavyweights Times New Roman and Plantin before that. Also worth mentioning is the [Klim Type blog](https://klim-type.tumblr.com/); although relatively new it already features some incredible work in progress.

## Silence: In the Age of Noise

“Life is long, if we listen to ourselves often enough, and look up.”

[Silence: In the Age of Noise](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Silence-Age-Noise-Erling-Kagge/dp/0241309875/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1512205294&sr=8-1&keywords=silence+erling+kagge) was recommended to me by a friend. It's a short read in which Norwegian explorer Erling Kagge uses his experiences of walking alone for 50 days across Antarctica, to share the power of silence. If you value [mindfulness](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) and the practice of [slowing down](https://zenhabits.net/the-10-essential-rules-for-slowing-down-and-enjoying-life-more/) then definitely check it out.

P.S. – I apologies for sending this email on a Saturday. Yesterday I took a rare day off to help my dad fix a roof. Somehow I managed to forget about the internet all day.
