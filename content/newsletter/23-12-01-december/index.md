We’re finally in our new house! 

Perhaps I’m being naïve, but selling our flat and buying a house has taken far more time and attention than I imagined.

The process took around 8 months in total, which actually seems quite quick when I think about it. Even so, it’s been difficult to focus on side projects during that time. And possibly the reason you’ve received newsletters late on numerous occasions this year.

Anyway, it feels great to have finally reached the end of that journey and to be sitting here in my new office, albeit surrounded by boxes. 

In the new year, I plan to regain some of that focus, for my newsletter, [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) and a few other projects I’ve had in the pipeline for some time.

Until then, here are my highlights and bookmarks from November. And my plans for the month of December.

## Highlights from last month

The big one, of course, was moving house.

I also launched [Solarsimple](https://crimson-cobra.cloudvent.net/). 

I published two posts on my website: a roundup of my [subscriptions](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/subscriptions/) in a bid to keep on top of monthly outgoings, and a reply to that [App defaults](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/app-defaults/) post which has been doing the rounds.

I finished season 1 of The X-files. Roll on season 2.
