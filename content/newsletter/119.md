Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #119, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## News

It’s been a while since I published an article. I had a good year of writing last year but I felt the pressure to replicate that this year. Saying that I managed to hit publish this morning on something that’s been sitting in my drafts folder for a while. This week I will begin with that.

[Expert and beginner](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/expert-beginner/). A short piece I wrote about learning from others and keeping an open mind.

## Thought provoking

[Norwegian banknotes: Original design and main concept](https://www.metricdesign.no/posts/norwegian-banknotes-design-proposals). A beautiful case study of the design and visual concept used for the new Norwegian banknotes.

## Design and Code

## Typography

[Klim Type Foundry](https://klim.co.nz/) launch their new website alongside [Söhne](https://klim.co.nz/blog/soehne-design-information/), a new release touted as ‘the memory of Akzidenz-Grotesk framed through the reality of Helvetica’. I particularly like the page [26,520 words about letters](https://klim.co.nz/blog/tag/font-design-information/) where you can find the font design information for each of one of their typefaces.

Cameron Chapman shares some [Tips and Considerations When Choosing a Typeface](https://www.toptal.com/designers/typography/choosing-a-typeface-infographic).

[Factor A](https://type.today/en/journal/factor_a) by Ilya Naumoff is a versatile sans with wild alternatives.

## Something to watch

”The end point is what you’ve been striving for the whole entire time... and the most dissatisfying part of the journey.”

[Coast to Coast](https://www.albioncycling.com/2019/11/watch-coast-to-coast/) is a new short film by Albion, which tells the story of a ride across the north of England. A single continuous ride of nearly 500 kilometres from the east to the west coast, through three of England’s most beautiful national parks.
