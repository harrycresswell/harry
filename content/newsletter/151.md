Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #151, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“Designing for diversity and inclusion isn’t that hard. First, we need to see the that bias slips into our design decisions. Then we can bring frameworks and tools into the design process that will help us see where we can be more inclusive.” Aarron Walter in [3 Amazing resources to help you design for diversity and inclusion](https://www.aarronwalter.com/blog/3-amazing-resources-to-help-you-design-for-diversity-and-inclusion).

”If you want to help save the planet, reduce digital weight. Clean up your website. Before you add an image, make sure that it does something useful and it’s the most optimized image possible. Every time you add code, make sure it does something useful and it’s the leanest code possible. Always be on the lookout for waste images, waste code, waste content. Get into the habit of removing something every time you add something.” Gerry McGovern in [Webwaste](https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/).
