Hi everyone,

Welcome to issue #183. I hope you’re all safe and doing well. 

This past month I’ve mostly been [building themes](https://harrycresswell.com/updates/building-themes/), [working with data](https://harrycresswell.com/updates/working-with-data/), thinking about [creative constraints](https://harrycresswell.com/updates/creative-constraints/) and trying to write [less CSS](https://harrycresswell.com/updates/less-css/). Alongside all the usual client commitments, of course.

Here’s a few things that have caught my eye over the course of February.

## Thought provoking

*“What obvious thing are we missing?”* is a better question than *“What exciting thing could we be doing?”* Harry Dry in [7 Backlinks in 27 minutes](https://marketingexamples.com/seo/simple-links).

“Sharing your ideas online allows others to access your knowledge without taking your time.” Love this idea from David Perell.

[How To Read A Book](https://dkb.io/post/how-to-read-a-book) DKB shares a practical system for implementing better reading.

## Design and Code

[A Complete Guide to CSS Cascade Layers](https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/). Miriam Suzanne explains the problem cascade layers help solve and how to start using them.

[CSS Scroll Snap Slide Deck That Supports Live Coding](https://css-tricks.com/css-scroll-snap-slide-deck/). Stephanie Eckles builds an awesome no-JavaScript slide deck in Codepen.

## Performance and sustainability

[Reducing The Web’s Carbon Footprint: Optimizing Social Media Embeds](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/reducing-web-carbon-footprint-optimizing-social-media-embeds/). A fantastic article from Michelle Barker on the top offenders causing page bloat and poor performance, including lots of useful tips to help deal with the problem.

I recently discovered [Digital Waste Explained](http://digitalwasteaudit.com/digitalwasteexplained.html) by the brilliant Gerry McGovern, author of [World Wide Waste](https://gerrymcgovern.com/books/world-wide-waste/). 34 declarations that will make you question the sustainability of your digital practices.

## Privacy and security

[How to protect your privacy, fight spam and reclaim control of your email address](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell/status/1496530301664694275?s=20&t=W-M_-NUPEkdu2qqnH3UhzQ). A short thread on email masking, which I’ve recently become a big fan of.

## Typography

[Roboto Serif](https://material.io/blog/roboto-serif). The newest member of the Roboto superfamily is designed to make reading more comfortable at any size, in any format.

[Comic Sans is a good typeface, actually](https://ericwbailey.design/writing/comic-sans-is-a-good-typeface-actually/). Eric Bailey on the perception of Comic Sans as an inferior typeface.

## Something to watch

Earlier this month I watched [The Alpinist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRpVyzagXLQ), a fascinating documentary about young climber Marc-André Leclerc. His accomplishments and outlook on life are remarkable.
