Wow, so many great reads flying round the web right now. I must apologise for stuffing this issue full to the brim with my favourites.

Unfortunately, non of those reads are written by me. I’ve rather neglected my personal site the last month or so, as most my non-client work effort has been focused on getting the first part of [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com/) to a place where it’s ready for launch. I’m pleased to say it’s not far off.

Anyway, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

- Watched We Live in Time, The Chosen: The Last Supper and The X-Files.
- Spent time in Bonn with R’s family and Mainz with friends.
- Celebrated mums birthday in London with family.
- Watched the Lionesses win the Euro’s...again.

## Elsewhere on the web

[A Friendly Introduction to SVG](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/svg/friendly-introduction-to-svg/) from Josh W Comeau.

> “It’s like an alternate-reality version of HTML that focuses on illustration instead of documentation, and we can use our existing CSS/JS skills to make them dynamic.”

I think Josh may well be the best person to follow if you want to get a proper grasp on
working with SVG.

[A handy use of subgrid to enhance a simple layout](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-handy-use-of-subgrid-to-enhance-a-simple-layout/) from Andy Bell.

I have to admit, I’ve yet to find a reason to use subgrid but here’s a great use case.

[The Media's Pivot to AI Is Not Real and Not Going to Work](https://www.404media.co/the-medias-pivot-to-ai-is-not-real-and-not-going-to-work/) by Jason Koebler (Free subscription required).

> “You have to compete on quality at this point and you have to find a real human being audience and you need to speak to them directly and treat them as though they are intelligent and not as though you are trying to feed them as much slop as possible.“

 Seems like good advise on how to survive as a content creator when you’re swimming in a cesspool of AI generated slop.

[The Hater's Guide To The AI Bubble](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/)  by Ed Zitron.

A long but eye opening argument as to why the AI industry is a lot more fragile than it seems.

[Since AI is a Money Pit, Enshittification Occurs Rapidly](https://theinternet.review/2025/07/01/ai-is-a-money-pit/) from Jared White. 

On a similar note to Ed’s post, Jared shares some positive predictions on how the AI bubble might pan out.

[Curate your own newspaper with RSS](https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/) by Molly White

A brilliant explanation of why media platforms suck and why it’s only getting worse. Followed by a great introduction to the enshittification-proof solution: RSS. It’s been around for years. It’s fantastic. If you’re not already using it, then now is the time.

[Fonts In Use is not active on Instagram](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/63903/fonts-in-use-is-not-active-on-instagram) from Nick Sherman.

> ”Even if you don’t completely leave those platforms, you can always start building up an independent presence in tandem – on a decentralized social network, your own website, and/or an email newsletter – where you control your own content and aren’t trapped by any one gatekeeper to maintain connections with your community.”

A short but timely read about why “being where the eyes are” is no longer necessarily beneficial for business.

[Ukko Wordpress and React theme](https://www.usecue.com/blog/ukko-wordpress-and-react-theme/). 

Joost van der Schee has rebuilt an unoptimised portfolio theme as a Hugo theme. Fixing a bunch of accessibility and performance issues in the process. Needless to say, it’s much better than the original.

[How to Make Websites That Will Require Lots of Your Time and Energy](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/how-to-make-websites-that-require-lots-of-time-and-energy/). 

I enjoyed this ever so slightly ironic post from Jim Nielsen. 

## What I’m up to in August

- All the usual client commitments.
- All the usual personal projects.
- Heading to All Points East to see The Maccabees.
- Running and skiing.
