Hey everyone,

Welcome to Braintactics #113, a weekly round up of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

If you read one thing this week make it [The World-Wide Work](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-world-wide-work/), Ethan Marcotte’s fantastic talk on automation, power, justice, and labor in the tech industry.

An excellent piece exploring the influence of design, how patterns in the live cycle of technology impact society and how union and collaboration provide both power and leverage.

## Thought provoking

“We have to look at design as an agent of power. Of something capable of good, yes, but of something equally capable of harm. Even if we don’t always mean to do it, our work can privilege the privileged, and exclude marginalized populations.” [The World-Wide Work](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-world-wide-work/).

[James Clear and Cal Newport](https://soundcloud.com/jamesclear/james-clear-and-cal-newport) discuss focus, habits, and productivity in an 1-hour long discussion.

## Design and Code

[CSS Circles](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/css-circles/). Tyler Sticka shares the various techniques for defining dynamic circular shapes in HTML and CSS, each with it’s pros and cons.

## Typography

[Public type works](https://www.publictype.works/) help type designers get paid for the creation of new open source fonts. Pledge your support for a font in the making and if enough people show interest, the designer will complete the font and make it available for everyone, for free.

[Advanced Lesson of the Firefox Font Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYP7jKMWkVY). Jen Simmons shows us some of the nuances and details of the tools built into Firefox for refining typography.

## Something to watch

[The visual future of content editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPDCmbaEF0Y). In the future, DX and UX will merge and content management will be more visual while giving devs the control they need.
