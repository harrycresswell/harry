I’m back in Hamburg, resting my legs after running the Hella Halbmarthon on Sunday with a friend out here. It was a hot one, we totally messed up our pacing, but it was great fun nonetheless. I managed to come in bang on the 2hr mark after chasing down the 2hr pacer with a 23min final 5km. Pretty happy with that.

As per usual, here are my highlights from the past month, a few good links from around the web and what I have planned for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Published [Hugo Version Manager](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/hugo-version-manager/).

Watched [Andor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9253284/), [London: 2000 years of History](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9845484/), [Clarkson’s Farm 4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10541088/) and a bunch of Glastonbury Festival.

Celebrated my [39th birthday](/now/25-06-16/), then celebrated [the 40th of an old friend from uni](/now/25-06-21/).

Ran the [Hella Hamburg Halbmarathon](/now/25-06-29/).

Read [Foundation by Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(Asimov_novel)).

Had great fun played padel for the first time. Apparently I’m late to the party, or so my friends on social media keep telling me.

## Elsewhere on the web

[What We Lost with PHP and jQuery](https://idiallo.com/blog/what-we-lost-with-php-and-jquery). As the complexity of web development continues to increase, simple, straight-forward solutions are often still the best. A wonderful reminder from Ibrahim Diallo.

On a similar note, I enjoyed reading Kyrylo Silin’s obscene but brilliant one-pager [Just fucking use HTML](https://justfuckingusehtml.com/). 

I highly recommend reading Alex Chan’s four part mini series on bookmarking using static websites, in particular [Creating a static website for all my bookmarks](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/bookmarks-static-site/) and [Building a personal archive of the web, the slow way](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/personal-archive-of-the-web/).

[How to show content on specific dates in Hugo](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-show-content-on-specific-dates-in-hugo/). A helpful post from Chris Ferdinandi on dealing with ephemeral content. I shared a similar technique in my post [CSS Naked Day](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/css-naked-day/).

[We launched our first Shopify theme](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/we-launched-our-first-shopify-theme/). Nic and Marianne have taken serious care and attention in developing their new Shopify theme. It’s great to hear how accessibility was a top priority, CSS was written framework free and that the theme makes heavy use of reliable web components. Well worth a read.

Whilst you’re on Nic’s site, make sure you check out [You're not a front-end developer until you've...](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/youre-not-a-front-end-developer-until-youve/) and see how you get on with the quiz. No doubt it will resonate.

## What I’m up to in July

- All the usual client commitments.
- All the usual personal projects.
- Back to indoor skiing with my brother.
- Back to weekly ParkRun.
- Heading to Bonn to celebrate R’s sisters graduation, then onto Mainz to spend time with some of R’s friends and colleagues.
- Celebrating mums birthday.
