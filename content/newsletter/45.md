Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Complexity and experience in design

“Go slow. Be clear. Stick with it.” A reminder against speed, unnecessary complexity and change for changes sake from designer Frank Chimero during [his talk at Awards Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koS4vjSux8A). Much of the talk is available in article format; [Everything Easy is Hard Again](https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/).

If you don’t already know [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/about/), you may well be familiar with [his work on Abstract](https://frankchimero.com/design/abstract/), the version control tool for designers. I can’t even imagine design without [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) these days.

## Making art with code

[Drawing With Numbers](https://daneden.me/2016/11/02/drawing-with-numbers/) is an interesting read from [Dan Eden](https://twitter.com/_dte/) about how he got into making [Generative art](https://daneden.me/uploads/2016/11/dwn-fabric.png) — that is, artwork created with the use of autonomous systems — using a Javascript framework called [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

If this sort of thing sounds interesting to you, checkout [Daniel Shiffman’s intro to p5.js](https://youtu.be/8j0UDiN7my4) and the work of [Anders Hoff](http://inconvergent.net/), in particular his essay [On Generative Algorithms](http://inconvergent.net/generative/).

## A few things on type

[Weird Type](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/weird-type/id1352785248?mt=8) is an AR IOS app that lets you paint with text in space. Built by [Zach Lieberman](https://twitter.com/zachlieberman) — another designer who makes art with code.

[Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) is a valuable read from [Mathew Butterick](https://mbtype.com/bio.html), who may well be the only typographer-slash-lawyer from Hollywood. [Straight and Curly Quotes](https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html) could be the most useful chapter.

## For your ears

I’ve been listening to [Kasper Bjørke](http://www.kasperbjorke.com/) this week. [Rays](https://soundcloud.com/kasperbjorke/rays) and [Zenith (feat. Null & Void)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swTahuuILK0), taken from his 2016 mini LP [Fountain of Youth](https://hfn.lnk.to/FountainOfYouth), are particular favourites.
