Writing anything at the moment is proving painfully difficult. I’ve got out of the habit, due to a bit of time off and various other commitments. 

I usually find the ol’ newsletter is a good chance to get the wheels turning once more. This format I use helps. Like following a recipe, it makes it a whole lot easier and helps lead the way.

So here’s what’s been happening and what I’m planning for the month ahead.

## Highlights from last month

Island hopping in the Canary Islands. We visited 3 islands in a couple of weeks: Tenerife, La Gomera and La Palma. All incredible in their own ways. We could have easily been out there for a month or two.

[Cosmos by Carl Sagan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55030.Cosmos) has been sitting on my bookshelf for years. I should have picked it up sooner. Great book.

Finishing the first phase of the [Mew app redesign](https://www.figma.com/file/5vxllAgi9HBwn7qyAjeiMI/Mew-app-(Main)?type=design&node-id=1114%3A11201&mode=design&t=2t8nZhh5WGZpAVdi-1).

Launching [Solarsimple](https://crimson-cobra.cloudvent.net/).

## Elsewhere on the web

I enjoyed reading Michelle’s [Greenwashing and the Cop28 website](https://css-irl.info/greenwashing-and-the-cop28-website/) and Fershad’s follow up [COP28 UAE: A Low Carbon Website Review](https://fershad.com/writing/cop28-uae-a-low-carbon-website-review/).

I learnt a few things in [Styling External Links with Attribute Selectors](https://css-irl.info/styling-external-links-with-attribute-selectors/) also from Michelle.

[It all means nothing in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0v2YJLq8n8) is a fantastic talk by Amy Hupe about finding meaning in your work.

[You are UI. Can you guess what your soul is?](https://martinsandstrom.com/you-are-ui-can-you-guess-what-your-soul-is/). An interesting analogy explaining the difference between UX and UI, from Martin Sandström.

## What I’m up to this month

I plan on finding more time for side projects in December.

I’m close to putting some [Practical Hugo](https://practicalhugo.com) content out, but I’ve been saying that for a while, I know. It’s taken far longer than I anticipated, but isn’t that true of everything worthwhile. Now we’re nearly there with our house move there’s not much holding me back.

I’m currently reading [The man who mastered gravity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124306756-the-man-who-mastered-gravity) which I’m enjoying. 

I’m also slowing working my way through [The X-files](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/) – just as good as I remember.
