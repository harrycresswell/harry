I was on holiday last week, so this oneâ€™s coming to you later than usual. 

I probably should have done something clever like schedule it in advance, but I didnâ€™t have time for that, sadly. Itâ€™s been a busy month, celebrating birthdays, selling our flat, monitoring our blood sugar. You know, the usual stuff! 


## âœ¨ Highlights from last month

- Spent time in German celebrating the 90th birthday of Rebekkaâ€™s Opa.
- Celebrating my own birthday with family and friends.
- Spent two weeks wearing a blood glucose monitor (and doing a bunch of other tests) for the [Zoe personalised nutrition program](https://joinzoe.com/).
- Took a family trip to Cornwall; where we spent time in Portscatho, Falmouth, St Mawes,  Mevagissy and at the fantastic Eden Project.
