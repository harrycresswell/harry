If you have roughly a thousand true fans (or  super fans), you can make a living — if you are content to make a living but not a fortune.

A *true fan* is defined as a fan that will buy anything you produce.

- You have to create enough each year that you can earn, on average, $100 profit from each true fan.
- You must have a direct relationship with your fans — i.e they must pay you directly.

If you keep the full $100 of each true fan, then you need only 1,000 of them to earn $100,000 per year. That’s a living for most folks.

A thousand customers is a whole lot more feasible to aim for than a million fans.

The number 1,000 is not absolute — I.e if you only earn $50 per year per true fan then you would need 2,000 fans.

This idea has been made possible by peer-to-peer communication and payment systems — in other words the internet.

This new technology permits creators to maintain relationships, so that the customer can become a fan, and so that the creator keeps the total amount of payment, which reduces the number of fans needed.

Whatever your interests as a creator are, your 1,000 true fans are one click from you. As far as I can tell there is nothing — no product, no idea, no desire — without a fan base on the internet. Every thing made, or thought of, can interest at least one person in a million — it’s a low bar.

## Takeaway

- 1,000 true fans is an alternative path to success other than stardom.
- Instead of trying to reach the narrow and unlikely peaks of platinum bestseller hits, blockbusters, and celebrity status, you can aim for direct connection with a thousand true fans.
- On your way, no matter how many fans you actually succeed in gaining, you’ll be surrounded not by faddish infatuation, but by genuine and true appreciation.
- It’s a much saner destiny to hope for. And you are much more likely to actually arrive there.
