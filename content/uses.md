My office setup and the app and services I use day to day, inspired by the great [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses/).

## Home office

In 2022 I switched to the [MacBookPro M1 14”](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro-14-and-16/), after my 15” MacBook Pro (Mid 2015) finally gave out. The M1 is a beast. I haven’t heard the fans spin once since making the switch. I went for the base model which is more than enough for my needs.

My laptop sits on a [Roost Laptop Stand](https://www.therooststand.com/), which I cannot recommend highly enough. I picked mine up during the Kickstarter, so it’s an early model, but it doesn’t seem like they’ve changed much since then. It’s strong, collapsible and super light, so you can take it everywhere.

I’ve been using an [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLA22B/A/magic-keyboard-british-english) and [Apple Magic Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ2R2Z/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver) combo for years now, and I’m happy with both. 

My [Dell P2415Q Monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/inch-Dell-P2415Q-IPS-Monitor/dp/B00QAJ2MOM/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Dell+P2415Q&qid=1584572080&sr=8-1) I don’t have much of an opinion about. It’s certainy not the best out there, but it gets the job done.

I’ve had [Logitech x-230 speakers](https://www.ebay.co.uk/i/333518493626?chn=ps) since what feels like the beginning of time. I remember using them when I made music at university back in 2006. They’re still going strong and kick out a good bit of bass, so I’ve stuck with them.

After 7 years of service, including a screen and battery replacement, I finally decided to upgrade my Apple iPhone X. I’m now using an iPhone 15, which I picked up refurbished from Back Market.

My [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) were a more recent purchase, and I only have good things to say–one of the best Apple product releases in a good while.

I work at a [606 Universal Shelving System Desk Shelf](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/606/components#desk-shelf). Combined with the rest of the shelving, this the most expensive piece of furniture I own. But I use it everyday, and it’s home to many of my favourite books, so it was well worth the price. 

I sit on a [Herman Miller Aeron Chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) which I found on eBay for a decent price.

## Design

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)† is my go-to design tool. I find myself using it for all sorts of design related work, not just UI. However, since the Adobe takeover, I’ve been looking into using [Penpot](https://penpot.app/)**, an open-source competitor, particularly for use with personal projects.

[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) has replaced Photoshop as my choice for photo editing and creating raster based graphics. Affinity software is fast, intuitive to learn and you can’t beat a one-off payment over a monthly subscription.

[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) and [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/) are also installed on my machine. I use these two apps less so than Photo, but they’re handy to have for vector illustration and creating print assets, respectively.

[Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com) is my choice for designing typefaces and icons. It’s super intuitive and a lot of fun to use.

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)** has a feature called Trace Bitmap which does a great job of replacing Adobe Illustrator’s Live Trace, so this is what I use it for.


## Web development

[Hyper](https://hyper.is/) is my go-to terminal. I use it with a couple of plugins installed–[hyper-night-owl](https://hyper.is/store/hyper-night-owl) theme and [hyperborder](https://github.com/webmatze/hyperborder)–to improve the visual apperence.

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my text editor of choice. However, I also use [Typora](https://typora.io/) when writing markdown for its seemless preview. 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a key part of my workflow. Working with static site generators and [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) it’s hard to avoid. I use [Github](https://github.com/) to host all my code remotely.

In 2021 I committed to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build content based websites. I use it for both client projects and all sorts of personal projects. Having worked with a bunch of different tools in the past – WordPress, Jekyll, Gatsby and Eleventy to name a few – Hugo is hands down my favourite to work with.

I use [Cloudcannon](https://cloudcannon.com/), a git-based content management system, for any client project which requires a CMS. Unlike most content management systems, Cloudcannon was built with Hugo in mind. Having worked with Netlify CMS (now [Decap](https://decapcms.org/)), Forestry (now discontinued) and Sanity in the past, Cloudcannon the best I’ve found for websites built with Hugo. 

For hosting and deployment I currently use Cloudcannon (which uses Cloudflare under the hood) for client sites and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for personal projects. 

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) is a digital asset manager which I use to generate image transformations (various image sizes, formats, styles and so on) on the fly. It’s handy for larger sites, where you’d like to remove media files from your Git repo to improve your build times.

In 2023 I switch my clients from Google Analytics to [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/). Unlike Google, Fathom respects vistor data and privacy and can be installed on up to 50 different sites. Perfect if you manage lots of websites. I also run a self-hosted instance of [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is/) for certain personal projects.

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/) is where I test ideas with code in a self contained environment. It’s a helpful tool if you want to try something out or work on specific feature without the distraction of an entire codebase.

## Privacy and security

I use [Simplelogin](https://simplelogin.io/) to generate email aliases for all the accounts I create. If you’re new to email aliases, I’ve written all about it in [Masking email](/writing/masking-email/).

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)** is my prefered password manager and I’ve tried many over the years. It integrates nicely with SimpleLogin, which means I can generate email aliases, along with passwords, from directly within the app.

I have [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) set up to open at login. If my laptop is on, then NordVPN is running. It masks my IP, protects me from trackers and malware, and when using the internet on public Wi-Fi. 

[Signal](https://www.signal.org)** is the open source messaging app we should probably all be using, though I find myself mostly using [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/).

I made the switch from Dropbox to [Sync](https://www.sync.com/) at the beginning of 2021 after researching secure, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage providers.

I switched from Google Workspace to [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)** at the beginning of 2022 and haven’t looked back. I’ve written about [my experience with Tutanota](/writing/privacy-focused-email/) in detail. I also use Tutanota’s encrypted Calendar.

~~[Raivo OTP](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raivo-otp/id1459042137)** is a fantastic open source authenticator app which I use to generate one-time passwords. It seemlessly handles back up and sync across iOS and MacOS devices.~~ Since the [suspicious circumstances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0IkcyGUqKc) surrounding the Raivo takeover, I’ve switched to using [2FAS](https://2fas.com/), another popular open source one-time/2FA password generator.

[Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si)** is another fantastic open source tool, which I use for video calls. Calls are encrypted and you don’t need an account to use it, which is a bonus.

[Tresorit Send](https://send.tresorit.com) is brilliant for sending big files, end-to-end encrypted.

[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) is a lightweight anti-malware and virus removal software which quietly runs in the background, performing a daily scan of your system to keep it protected.

## Reading

I recently started using a [Kobo Clara Colour](https://uk.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-colour), along with the [Kobo Books app](https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/p/apps) to read ebooks. It plays nice [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) which I use to manage my ebooks. I’ve kept hold of my old [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-paperwhite/s?k=kindle+paperwhite) for now, though I can’t say I use it much anymore.

[NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com)** is my RSS reader of choice. If that doesn’t mean much to you, then think of it as curating your own feed of content from people or websites that you want to follow. But without some algorithm controlling how you receive content. Content arrives chronologically and it couldn’t be more simple.

## Bookmarking and highlights

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) and [Reader](https://readwise.io/read) are quickly becoming my favourite two tools. The latter I use as a “read it later” app — for saving long form content like blog posts and YouTube videos — though it can also be used as an RSS reader. I use the former to save highlights from my Kobo and Kindle, which are then rolled up in a daily review. Any highlights made in Reader or by using [Readwise Highlighter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/readwise-highlighter/jjhefcfhmnkfeepcpnilbbkaadhngkbi) will also end up in the daily review.

One of the main reasons I was drawn to Kobo is the integration with [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/), which I now use to save any article that I want to read on my Kobo. Reading web content on an e-ink reader is a real gamechanger.

I recently discovered [Anybox](https://anybox.app/), an incredible little macOS app for managing bookmarks that works with iCloud. I use it to save anything that doesn’t fall into the long form content category. Things like useful tools, products and resources. 

Previously I used Notion for bookmarking – saving web pages using the Notion Web Clipper – but Notion databases are really clunky when you’re dealing with thousands of entries. I’ve also tried bookmarking with Airtable and more recently Obisidan. I have to admit I’m yet to settle on a system I’m 100% happy with.

## Writing

[Typora](https://typora.io) allows you to write markdown in preview, so it feels more like working in Google Docs and less like a code editor. Typora has a great outline panel which helps you structure your articles. These days I’ll create a markdown post with Hugo, then open it in Typora and work on the content from there. Before now I would have composes drafts elsewhere, then copy them across to Hugo. This new approach is seamless and allows you to version control your work.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** is my note taking tool of choice. I’m not yet using it to it’s full potential as a second brain, but this is something I plan on working on in the future. I’ve also started using it for journaling and planning OKR with Quarterly, Weekly and Daily notes.

I use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) with caution. It’s helpful for picking up typos, bad grammar and so on, but I find it can strip the personality from your writing.

[Hemmingway](https://hemingwayapp.com) I find helpful for cleaning up lengthy sentances and spotting passive voice. But, a

I find myself using [Apple Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes/) for fleeting notes written when I’m on the go. These aren’t usually notes I want to keep long-term, so from time to time I’ll have a big clearout and delete them all.

## Project management

I recently switched to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for personal project management (using the P.A.R.A method) after [falling out with Notion](/writing/notion-no-more). What I like most about Obsidian is that it’s text-based, fast and self-hosted. Ultimately, it’s just a bunch of markdown files, so it works great without an internet connection. This also means content is highly portable, should I wish to move tools in the future.

I’ve returned to [Trello](https://trello.com/) for client projects that require collaboration. It’s simple to onboard clients with and easy to understand.

[PandaDoc](https://www.pandadoc.com/) is great for collection e-signatures on proposals and work agreements. I like to design these docs in Figma, then upload them to PandaDoc to collect the signature. It’s a nice feature which means you don’t have to use a pre-built template.

[Screenity](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screenity-screen-recorder/kbbdabhdfibnancpjfhlkhafgdilcnji?ref=producthunt)** is a great tool for async video communication. Record quick videos via a browser extension, get a link to the video and share the URL with clients or colleagues. It’s a great way to get out of unnecessary meetings.

I use [TinyStopwatch](https://apps.apple.com/app/tinystopwatch/id1447754003) for time tracking tasks that typically get billed to clients.


## Business and finance

[JF Financial](https://jf-financial.co.uk/) have been my accountants since 2015. If you’re based in the UK and, like me, are a freelancer or a contractor, then I can highly recommend John and his team.

I use [FreeAgent](http://fre.ag/44clni8a)* as my accounting software and have done since working with my accountants (they include a free subscription). FreeAgent makes it very easy to create invoices and manage expenses. If you run your own business in the UK and you’re not using a digital accounting tool, then checkout Freeagent.

My business is insured by [With Jack](https://withjack.co.uk/). They protect freelance creatives in the UK who are set up as either sole traders or limited companies.

I use [Starling](https://www.starlingbank.com/referral?code=rkNWmT)* as my UK business bank account.

I use [Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/harryc454)* to collect payments in foreign currencies from international clients. With Wise you can set up a local bank account and receive payments much faster than with a domestic bank account.

I recently made the switch from [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) to [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/), which I use to send my personal newsletter and Practical Hugo updates. I’ve been recommending Brevo to my european clients, so it makes sense that I’m using the same tool. Brevo has a partnership program, making it agency friendly, so we’ll also be using it at [ERYN](https://studioeryn.com/). 

[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) is the tool I use to handle online payments for things like fonts or themes. 

I use [Buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) for donations.

## Automation

I use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to send emails to myself, reminding me to do things that happen periodically. Things like updating the masked email address I use on this site. Or sending out my newsletter. Both of these things I only do once a month, so they’re easy to forget without IFTTT. 

I also use [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (similar to IFTTT), mostly to pass form submissions to spreadsheets.


## Health

I use [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) to track running and the Apple Watch Activity app for tracking yoga sessions and workouts.

I recently switched from [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)† to Obsidian for habit tracking.

Having tried many of the meditation apps out there, my current favourite for guided meditation is [Balance](https://balanceapp.com/). For unguided meditation I use [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/).

~~I use the [Zoe](https://zoe.com/) app for logging and scoring recipes and meals.~~

## Misc

[Numi](https://numi.app/)** is my go-to calculator app. It looks and feels more like a terminal and you can write commands in a natural way. For example: “1 inch in cm” will return `1 inch in cm`.

[Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/) is a great little app that helps you stay focused by allowing you to mix and match different background sounds. I use the iOS version mainly, but there’s also a web app.

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)** is an application window manager that helps you neatly resize and organise open windows using keyboard shortcuts. It’s great for resizing your code editor and a web browser side-by-side.

[Maccy](https://maccy.app)** I discovered recently. It keeps a history of all the things you’ve copied to your clipboard to make them easier to access. Very handy, particularly for web development.

[CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/) is a handy tool for finding large files and freeing up space on your machine.

[Mailwip](https://mailwip.com/) allows you to send and receive emails using unlimited addresses from your own domain. I use it with clients who wish to send emails using a business domain name from their personal Gmail account.

[QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/quicktime-player/welcome/mac) seems to be the most stable app I can find for creating offline screen recordings.

[Apple Reminders](https://www.icloud.com/reminders/) is the tool I use to create shopping lists. It works great for shared lists.
