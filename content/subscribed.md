Thanks for signing up for my monthly newsletter, it’s great to have you on board.

## What to expect

At the beginning of each month, I’ll send you an email containing a round up of what I’ve been up to the past month, things that have caught my interest online and what I have planned for the month ahead. That’s it.

## A little housekeeping

Please “whitelist” messages from **mail@harrycresswell.com** in your email client so they arrive in your inbox and not somewhere else. If you use Gmail, these emails may end up in your Promotional tab. Just click and drag the first newsletter I send you into your Primary inbox and you should be good to go.

## Whilst you’re here

If you have a minute, I’d love to know... what are you working on right now? Maybe it’s something I can help you with. Just hit the button below to send me an email.

With that said, I look forward to seeing you again at the beginning of the month.
